0,WOS:000378469900006,"A global multiregional input output (MRIO) model was built for eight Chinese cities to track their carbon flows. For in-depth understanding of urban carbon footprint from the perspectives of production, consumption, and trade balance, four kinds of footprints and four redefined measurement indicators were calculated. From the global supply chain, urban carbon inflows from Mainland China were larger than outflows, while the carbon outflows to European, principal North American countries and East Asia were much larger than inflows. With the rapid urbanization of China, Construction was the largest consumer and Utilities was the largest producer. Cities with higher consumption (such as Dalian, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Beijing) should change their consumption patterns, while cities with lower production efficiency (such as Dalian, Shanghai, Ningbo, and Chongqing) should improve their technology. The cities of net carbon consumption tended to transfer carbon emissions out of them by trading in carbon-intensive products, while the cities of net carbon production tended to produce carbon-intensive products for nonlocal consumers. Our results indicated that urban carbon abatement requires not only rational consumption and industrial symbiosis at the city level, but also tighter collaboration along all stages of the global supply chain.","Hu, YC, Lin, JY, Cui, SH, Khanna, NZ",,Beijing; Ningbo; Tianjin; Shanghai; Dalian; Chongqing,CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN,10.1021/acs.est.6b00985,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075); SRID=4326;POINT (121.54945 29.87819); SRID=4326;POINT (117.17667 39.14222); SRID=4326;POINT (121.45806 31.22222); SRID=4326;POINT (121.60222 38.91222); SRID=4326;POINT (106.55278 29.56278),11716620; 3491597; 11090314; 22315474; 4087733; 7457600,has_abstract; all,Measuring Urban Carbon Footprint from Carbon Flows in the Global Supply Chain,2016.0

How do-they contribute to redesign the world? The third book adopts, first and foremost, a strategic foresight approach including a scan of the future trends, tensions and risks in a more uncertain world, the possible and preferable futures, emerging policy issues, such as intergenerational cities or cities welcoming the immigrants and their impact on sustainable development, the Rio+20 prospects and the effects of the protracted crisis, efforts by world interconnected cities, including a case-study on Bangkok, a laboratory of urban change, and examples of frugal and resilient urban policies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

2,WOS:000383371000002,"Cities are thought to be associated with most of humanity's consumption of natural resources and impacts on the environment. Cities not only constitute major centers of economic activity, knowledge, innovation, and governancethey are also said to be linked to approximately 70% to 80% of global carbon dioxide emissions. This makes cities primary agents of change in a resource- and carbon-constraint world. In order to set meaningful targets, design successful policies, and implement effective mitigation strategies, it is important that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting for cities is accurate, comparable, comprehensive, and complete. Despite recent developments in the standardization of city GHG accounting, there is still a lack of consistent guidelines regarding out-of-boundary emissions, thus hampering efforts to identify mitigation priorities and responsibilities. We introduce a new conceptual frameworkbased on environmental input-output analysisthat allows for a consistent and complete reconciliation of direct and indirect GHG emissions from a city. The city carbon map shows local, regional, national, and global origins and destinations of flows of embodied emissions. We test the carbon map concept by applying it to the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia. We discuss the results and limitations of the approach in the light of possible mitigation strategies and policies by different urban stakeholders.","Wiedmann, TO, Chen, GW, Barrett, J",,Melbourne,AUS,10.1111/jiec.12346,SRID=4326;POINT (144.96332 -37.814),4246375,has_abstract; all,"The Concept of City Carbon Maps: A Case Study of Melbourne, Australia",2016.0
3,2-s2.0-85016769031,"Cities have experienced an unprecedented rate of growth in the last decade. More than half the world's population lives in urban areas, with the U.S. percentage at 80 percent. Cities have captured more than 80 percent of the globe's economic activity and offered social mobility and economic prosperity to millions by clustering creative, innovative, and educated individuals and organizations. Clustering populations, however, can compound both positive and negative conditions, with many modern urban areas experiencing growing inequality, debility, and environmental degradation. The spread and continued growth of urban areas presents a number of concerns for a sustainable future, particularly if cities cannot adequately address the rise of poverty, hunger, resource consumption, and biodiversity loss in their borders. Intended as a comparative illustration of the types of urban sustainability pathways and subsequent lessons learned existing in urban areas, this study examines specific examples that cut across geographies and scales and that feature a range of urban sustainability challenges and opportunities for collaborative learning across metropolitan regions. It focuses on nine cities across the United States and Canada (Los Angeles, CA, New York City, NY, Philadelphia, PA, Pittsburgh, PA, Grand Rapids, MI, Flint, MI, Cedar Rapids, IA, Chattanooga, TN, and Vancouver, Canada), chosen to represent a variety of metropolitan regions, with consideration given to city size, proximity to coastal and other waterways, susceptibility to hazards, primary industry, and several other factors. © 2016 by the National Academy of Sciences.

5,WOS:000246782200007,"The way urbanization unfolds over the next few decades in the developing countries of Asia will have profound implications for sustainability. One of the more important opportunities is to guide urbanization along pathways that begin to uncouple these gains in well-being from rising levels of energy use. Increasing energy use for transport, construction, climate control in houses and offices, and industrial processes is often accompanied by increasing levels of atmospheric emissions that impact human health, ecosystem functions, and the climate system. Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry alter carbon stocks and fluxes as carbon dioxide, methane, and black carbon. In this article we explore how carbon management could be integrated into the development strategies of cities and urbanizing regions. In particular, we explore how changes in urban form, functions, and roles might alter the timing, aggregation, spatial distribution, and composition of carbon emissions. Our emphasis is on identifying system linkages and points of leverage. The study draws primarily on emission inventories and regional development histories carried out in the regions around the cities of Manila, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New Delhi, and Chiang Mai. We find that how urban functions, such as mobility, shelter, and food, are provided has major implications for carbon emissions, and that each function is influenced by urban form and role in distinct ways.

6,WOS:000413546200001,"The SusKat-ABC (Sustainable Atmosphere for the Kathmandu Valley-Atmospheric Brown Clouds) international air pollution measurement campaign was carried out from December 2012 to June 2013 in the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding regions in Nepal. The Kathmandu Valley is a bowl-shaped basin with a severe air pollution problem. This paper reports measurements of two major greenhouse gases (GHGs), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), along with the pollutant CO, that began during the campaign and were extended for 1 year at the SusKat-ABC supersite in Bode, a semi-urban location in the Kathmandu Valley. Simultaneous measurements were also made during 2015 in Bode and a nearby rural site (Chanban) similar to 25 km (aerial distance) to the southwest of Bode on the other side of a tall ridge. The ambient mixing ratios of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured with a cavity ring-down spectrometer (G2401; Picarro, USA) along with meteorological parameters for 1 year (March 2013-March 2014). These measurements are the first of their kind in the central Himalayan foothills. At Bode, the annual average mixing ratios of CO2 and CH4 were 419.3 (+/- 6.0) ppm and 2.192 (+/- 0.066) ppm, respectively. These values are higher than the levels observed at background sites such as Mauna Loa, USA (CO2: 396.8 +/- 2.0 ppm, CH4: 1.831 +/- 0.110 ppm) and Waliguan, China (CO2: 397.7 +/- 3.6 ppm, CH4: 1.879 +/- 0.009 ppm) during the same period and at other urban and semi-urban sites in the region, such as Ahmedabad and Shadnagar (India). They varied slightly across the seasons at Bode, with seasonal average CH4 mixing ratios of 2.157 (+/- 0.230) ppm in the pre-monsoon season, 2.199 (+/- 0.241) ppm in the monsoon, 2.210 (+/- 0.200) ppm in the post-monsoon, and 2.214 (+/- 0.209) ppm in the winter season. The average CO2 mixing ratios were 426.2 (+/- 25.5) ppm in the pre-monsoon, 413.5 (+/- 24.2) ppm in the monsoon, 417.3 (+/- 23.1) ppm in the postmonsoon, and 421.9 (+/- 20.3) ppm in the winter season. The maximum seasonal mean mixing ratio of CH4 in winter was only 0.057 ppm or 2.6% higher than the seasonal minimum during the pre-monsoon period, while CO2 was 12.8 ppm or 3.1% higher during the pre-monsoon period (seasonal maximum) than during the monsoon (seasonal minimum). On the other hand, the CO mixing ratio at Bode was 191% higher during the winter than during the monsoon season. The enhancement in CO2 mixing ratios during the pre-monsoon season is associated with additional CO2 emissions from forest fires and agro-residue burning in northern South Asia in addition to local emissions in the Kathmandu Valley. Published CO = CO2 ratios of different emission sources in Nepal and India were compared with the observed CO = CO2 ratios in this study. This comparison suggested that the major sources in the Kathmandu Valley were residential cooking and vehicle exhaust in all seasons except winter. In winter, brick kiln emissions were a major source. Simultaneous measurements in Bode and Chanban (15 July-3 October 2015) revealed that the mixing ratios of CO2, CH4, and CO were 3.8, 12, and 64% higher in Bode than Chanban. The Kathmandu Valley thus has significant emissions from local sources, which can also be attributed to its bowl-shaped geography that is conducive to pollution build-up. At Bode, all three gas species (CO2, CH4, and CO) showed strong diurnal patterns in their mixing ratios with a pronounced morning peak (ca. 08:00), a dip in the afternoon, and a gradual increase again through the night until the next morning. CH4 and CO at Chanban, however, did not show any noticeable diurnal variations.

Urban transitions are interesting because they operate at both the national and global scales, concentrating people, wealth, and resources.

10,9xfbe,"The role of subnational governments in addressing climate change has been increasingly acknowledged in the past decade. Influential cities and states can facilitate the reduction of emissions and can be nimble in policy implementation where national governments falter (Betsill & Bulkeley, 2006; Bruyninckx et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2010; Falkner et al., 2010; Rabe, 2008; Schreurs, 2008). This emerging role is adding to the complexity of the international climate governance architecture, but also provides a potential alternative to top-­‐down and bottom-­‐up approaches. The ‘middle-­‐out’ approach, and the linkages it enables between the local, the national and the international levels, as well as with non-­‐ state actors is a factor in global climate change governance that needs to be better understood. This paper looks at the activity in both São Paulo (Brazil) and California (US) over the past decade to tackle climate change. While the contexts and starting points of both states are very diverse and the approaches taken have not been optimal in certain respects, there are some key similarities and successes which offer interesting insights into the role that states can play in leading progress towards global decarbonisation. The narrative of these activities is not exhaustive, but discusses some of the major and distinct areas in which leadership can be identified in both states around climate change law and policy. The paper argues that the subnational (state) level is uniquely situated to affect change and coordinate collaborative efforts with and between the other levels. Being closer to the people allows for context to be accounted for, and being smaller than the nation state, policy interventions can take more risks, be more experimental and innovative. Similarly, being larger than the city or municipal area, more policy levers are available to the state, can affect a much larger population and has more resources and capacity to deliver. Advocating a middle-­‐out approach, whereby the state can deliver policies and legislative frameworks that can be replicated ‘up’ and implemented ‘down’ puts the state as the ‘middle’ entity in a unique position as an important driver for economic, societal and environmental change to tackle many complex policy problems, such as climate change. Particularly in regard to the states of California and São Paulo, the paper argues that these subnational governments have established a practice of leadership in climate policy making. Both São Paulo and California introduced legislation with binding emission reduction targets and are taking action in the absence of a coordinated, ambitious national response. They are also active in domestic and transnational networks and seek a profile of ‘leadership’ both domestically and at the international level. The paper traces the leadership discourse of each state, and investigates how this discourse was built and how it was put in practice. The role that both states’ rhetoric is playing in raising awareness of the issue and this influence in the global climate governance regime will be explored. This paper firstly examines the literature on leadership generally and recent work on environmental and subnational leadership more specifically. We introduce the “middle-­‐ out” concept as it relates to the roles that subnational governments can exert in climate policy-­‐making. Before we move into the case study, a short introduction to the context of both Sao Paulo and California is offered. We then explore the activities that have taken place in or involving each state over the past decade, and which represents their leadership in addressing climate change.

12,9frhu,"The two great challenges facing cities worldwide in the decades to come are inequality and climate change. Yet the two challenges, and the two sets of political infrastructures that prioritize them, largely operate in isolation from each other. Often, it is argued or assumed that actions to redress social and environmental challenges are in tension; they must be balanced. In this paper, drawing on case studies of low-carbon policy and water scarcity in São Paulo, I argue that the opposite is true. I outline the case that, for both infrastructural and political reasons, the best strategy to slash carbon emissions and adapt to the inevitable climate-linked disasters we cannot prevent is for public authorities working with community-based groups and movements to take immediate action to reduce urban inequalities, housing inequality in particular. In short, the best way to prevent ecological breakdown is to democratically pursue climate policies that reduce social inequality. Shorter: effective urban climate politics converge with the already-thriving “right to the city” agenda. The “right to the city” concept originally dates to the late 1960s urban scholarship of French sociologist Henri Lefebvre, who understood this as referring to city-dwellers’ entitlement to shape and enjoy classic urban amenities like connectivity, culture, public services, economic security, and decent housing. More recently, geographers and sociologists have helped to specify a double-meaning lurking in the term when it is mobilized by social movements—a demand on the one hand for greater access to urban public goods, and on the other, for greater democratic influence in shaping the provision, quality, and governance of those goods (Weinstein and Ren 2009). While “the right to the city” is enshrined in some legal frameworks, like Brazil’s federal “Statute of the City”, it has never in practice gained a force of law analogous to more traditional, individualist rights that liberal legal frameworks have usually privileged (like the right to free speech). The “right to the city” has thus tended to be understood as a contested social right, focused on urban rather than national politics (cf Harvey 2008; Lefebvre 1996). But for reasons I will elaborate below, I want to argue that the idea turns out to embody an implicit climate politics that warrants far greater attention. I am not the first to suggest that there is overlap between social and ecological objectives in cities, although I take my insistence to be uncommonly strong. At least in normative terms, the orienting principles that United Nations agencies have been developing for cities also imply interconnection. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 11.1 reads, “By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.” (United Nations, n.d.). And objective 11.3 records the attractive (if vague) aspiration that, “By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries.” (United Nations, n.d.) Here, environment, housing, and citizen protagonism are all aggregated into a single agenda. Meanwhile, the UN’s New Urban Agenda, agreed at the Habitat III conference in 2016, commits the world’s governments to recognizing the existence of a “right to the city” concept—albeit in reluctant, clenched-jaw fashion: “We note the efforts of some national and local governments to enshrine this vision, referred to as ‘right to the city’, in their legislation, political declarations and charters” (United Nations 2017: 5). Even this passive-aggressive phrasing was only possible thanks to the determined lobbying of civil society groups, especially the International Alliance of Inhabitants. The New Urban Agenda also makes repeated references to the virtues of intelligent densification, public transit access, and affordable housing—all keystone demands of “right to the city” campaigns. Based on the UN documents, one can optimistically believe that there is now a kind of basic, baseline agreement at the world’s highest governmental levels that ongoing urbanization must reflect the needs and dreams of all city-dwellers, and that this urbanization must do so in sustainable fashion. Inequality and ecological crisis, the two great challenges for 21st century cities, are minimally combined at the UN level. The social and political question then runs, How do we achieve these objectives at once? How do we actually put into practice a climate-friendly right to the city? From the standpoint of a political sociologist, I seek to answer these questions by examining cities’ concrete, prosaic politics, with their hectic elections, vibrant social mobilizations, economic conflicts, and undulating public opinion. And I situate these in the context of global markets in urban goods and services that are presently exacerbating inequalities. I argue that for practical reasons, a compelling strategy for building broad support around lasting urban sustainability interventions is to pursue environmental politics that directly reduce housing inequalities through policies that counteract many real estate market forces, which price attractive and well-located housing in cities beyond the reach of poor, working-class, and even middle-class residents (cf Rolnik 2016); that market tendency makes it very difficult to implement ambitious, place-based environmental policies without accelerating social displacement. To construct such policies, politicians and other civil society leaders will have to find ways to combine the priorities of environmental and housing-oriented movements. As discussed at greater length below, the underlying technical reason for this is that decarbonizing urban life involves changes to core threads of the urban fabric—housing, transit, and land use; these are some of the most contested dimensions of urban life, however, and so changes to them can never be socially or politically neutral. Thus, to grasp the contested politics of this domain, I use a case study method that is especially attentive to political detail, reviewing lessons from my own research in São Paulo, where I have investigated both the fortunes of low-carbon policy and the politics around a historic drought—two cases where the politics of inequality and climate change were intertwined (Cohen 2016b; Cohen 2017). To paraphrase the opening of Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, each happy city is alike (i.e., a set of coordinates on a UN road map); but each unhappy city (i.e., actually existing city) is unhappy in its own way. An understanding of São Paulo’s case cannot stand in for investigating others, but may offer general principles that will have to be tested in other cases. Below, I first outline the global spread of density-oriented low-carbon urban policy projects, as well as the increasing prevalence of urban climate threats, which are mostly experienced in some form through water. I show how these efforts and challenges exemplify some key concerns that animate the UN Habitat and SDG process.

In particular, the recast of the European Energy Performance of Buildings supports the improvement of buildings energy performance and introduces a new target, the Nearly Zero-Energy Building (NZEB) concept. Nowadays, the European Commission is shifting attention towards the district level and post-carbon cities and Net Zero-Energy District (NZED) targets are emerging. In order to evaluate alternative strategies for the construction of NZED, according to a socio-economic point of view, different aspects and impacts have to be considered.

15,vzw82,"The electrification of the transportation sector promises far-reaching benefits for urban areas and the world. Electric mobility is critical to tackling climate change, reducing air pollution, and improving energy security. To achieve the goal set by the Paris Agreement on climate change of limiting global warming to well below 2° Celsius, the transport sector—which accounts for 20%1 of global CO2 emissions—will need to shift rapidly towards zeroemission options. This will only be possible through mass electrification of the transport sector coupled with decarbonization of the electricity grid. Moreover, even when run on electricity generated partly from fossil fuels, electric vehicles (EVs) emit significantly less greenhouse gas over their lifetimes than conventional vehicles due to their far greater efficiency.2 Decisions made today will determine whether the Paris goals can be met, as 70% of the forecast increase in emissions from developing countries is based on infrastructure that has not yet been built.3 With zero tailpipe emissions, EVs also make a huge contribution to improving air quality in areas where they are driven. In addition, electric mobility improves energy security by cutting fuel imports and diversifying the energy sources used for transportation. Electric cars and buses will add just 6% to global electricity demand by 2040, while the switch from conventional to electric vehicles will displace 7.3 million barrels per day of transport fuel, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.4 Even in markets that are small today, governments should start to prepare for an industry that is expected to grow rapidly. Local supply chains and service providers, such as auto maintenance shops, as well as transport-related businesses, like long haul trucking, urban distribution, and public transportation companies, will have to adapt to the new technology to remain competitive. Electric mobility has taken off in recent years, with global sales of electric cars, buses, motorcycles, and other vehicles steadily rising. The global stock of electric cars surpassed 3 million in 2017 after reaching 1 million in 2015 and 2 million in 20165 (see Figure 1). While demonstrating an impressive growth rate, EVs still represented only 0.2% of the total number of passenger light-duty vehicles in circulation in 2016.6 The stock of electric buses, meanwhile, increased to 370,000 in 2017, driven mostly by developments in China, which accounts for over 99% of the global electric bus market.7 Various forecasts predict rapid expansion (see Figure 2). The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2020 the global EV fleet will reach 13 million,8 while Bloomberg sees the global electric car fleet surging to 530 million by 2040.9 China will lead this transition, followed by Europe and the United States. Electric bus markets could advance even faster. By 2030, Bloomberg expects that 84% of global municipal bus sales will be electric. The fast growth in EV uptake has been due largely to policies adopted in a select group of countries as well as market developments. Policies to implement stronger fuel economy standards (which give car manufacturers incentives to invest in EV technology), tax incentives, and national electric mobility strategies have boosted sales. A significant drop in the cost and increase in the range of batteries is also driving growth. Meanwhile, new business models such as car sharing have made it easier for consumers to access electric cars. Various automakers are also stepping up with pledges to increase investments in EVs and develop new models, providing consumers with more options. Cities are the focal point for EV adoption, and many are setting ambitious goals to tackle climate change and promote clean transport. Fourteen cities, including Oslo, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Amsterdam, and San Jose, California, accounted for 32% of new EVs in 2015.10 Drivers in cities travel shorter distances and generally use smaller cars, making EVs more viable. Public transportation is more widely used, creating opportunities for electrification of larger vehicles that run throughout the day. And municipal governments have specific policy instruments at their disposal, such as building codes that mandate charging points, exemptions from road access and parking restrictions for EVs, and municipal public procurement strategies to introduce electric car and bus fleets. The mayors of 50 cities, including Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, and Santiago, have pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Since 2017, 14 cities, including Quito and Mexico City, have pledged to procure only zero-emission buses starting in 2025 and ensure that major areas of their cities are zero-emission by 2030.",,,Shenzhen; Shanghai; Amsterdam; Paris; Oslo; Buenos Aires; Mexico City; Quito; Santiago; San Jose,CHN; CHN; NLD; FRA; NOR; ARG; MEX; ECU; CHL; USA,,SRID=4326;POINT (114.0683 22.54554); SRID=4326;POINT (121.45806 31.22222); SRID=4326;POINT (4.88969 52.37403); SRID=4326;POINT (2.3488 48.85341); SRID=4326;POINT (10.74609 59.91273); SRID=4326;POINT (-58.37723 -34.61315); SRID=4326;POINT (-99.12766000000001 19.42847); SRID=4326;POINT (-78.52495 -0.22985); SRID=4326;POINT (-70.64827 -33.45694); SRID=4326;POINT (-121.89496 37.33939),10358381; 22315474; 741636; 2138551; 580000; 13076300; 12294193; 1399814; 4837295; 1026908,has_abstract; all,CHARGING AHEAD,2018.0
16,56smq,"South Africa possesses excellent renewable resources that can be harnessed to support the country’s energy future and create sustainable, local, and green manufacturing jobs. Locally produced biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, and electricity (generated from pv) can be secure, stable, and predictable sources of renewable fuel for municipal vehicle fleets at lifecycle costs less than or equal to Euro V diesel vehicles today. Existing local waste-to-biofuel manufacturing plants can and do convert waste and waste byproducts to biofuel without the traditional concerns of first generation biofuels – namely food versus fuel, land-use change, and water scarcity concerns – which delayed global consideration of mass green fleet conversions for understandable reasons. That said, agricultural biogas and agricultural bioethanol provide the largest number of fuel related green jobs IF jobs are the main driver of government. Agricultural-based biofuel can be harvested for municipal bus fleets on less than 1% of the marginal (non-productive) land in the country making a transition from first generation biofuel to second an easy transition with little downside. That said, if the environment wins over jobs in the political calculus, second generation waste to biofuel technology is available today in South Africa and can be reliably procured at below or equal to the price of diesel or CNG on a diesel-liter equivalency(DLE) / energy equivalency basis. Regardless of fuel source decision, the opportunity at todays $60 a barrel (March 2015) to wean South Africa off imported diesel for municipal fleets has never been greater. There is NO LONGER a green premium or financial penalty associated with going green. Moreover, a move to any of the diesel alternatives will reduce GHGs by 70% plus (biogas, bioethanol, electric supplied by PV), reduce tailpipe emissions and local air pollution (90% plus for CNG, biogas, bioethanol, or electric), and create local fuel jobs. The city of Johannesburg and Tshwane are leading by example and beginning the transition from diesel to CNG. With coordinated purchasing, a significant biogas industry can be immediately created (with an 18-24 month lag time for commercial scale plant development) and the above-mentioned cities can transition from CNG to biogas at zero cost to local government. In fact, biogas prices are roughly 10% cheaper for the exact same molecule on a per m3 basis and unlike a mandated CNG price can be negotiated to achieve greater economies of scale and greater savings to municipalities. Moreover, a large centralized purchase of fuel (biogas, bioethanol, cng) and vehicles (buses, waste trucks, lorries, bakkies, taxivans, or cars) can achieve multiple objectives of government at the same time: 1. Centralise and rationalise procurement (provide SCM expertise for multiple departments) 2. Centralise and rationalise the use of green fuel / green vehicle experts (reduce consultants) 3. Reduce per unit costs of fuel and vehicles (up to 15-20%) via economies of scale 4. Dramatically increase localization of fuel and vehicle manufacturing via one tender, jump starting a biofuel industry that has been crippled by lack of long-term off-take arrangements 5. Reduce the current account deficit by reducing the importation of oil 6. Decarbonize transport (the highest GHG emitting sector in SA) 7. Reduce one of the primary causes of respiratory illnesses & heart attacks of commuters that walk or take public transit (diesel exhaust) 8. Improve the sustainability of municipal finances by cutting life cycle fleet costs by 10-20% The key impediment to creating a large green transport sub- sector in the South African economy is the challenge of aggregating and financing municipal purchases of green fuel and vehicles. If a government led programme - similar to the successful Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme (REIPPP) supported by the Departments of Economic Development, Treasury, Transport, and Energy – aggregated the purchasing power of municipalities to achieve economies of scale in the purchase of green fuel and vehicle fleets, more renewable fuel supply and more green manufacturing jobs at better prices to local government could be secured. This could also be secured through a transversal contract (PMFA) with an open spec tender that allows multiple technologies to compete or via the MFMA with the award of a specific contract by one municipality being replicated. SACN is currently working with municipal transport officials and their leadership to gain visibility into their re-fleeting and fuel decisions as aggregation can also occur informally and across technologies, leaving each city to choose their technology and fuel of choice but ensuring their individual choices “count” towards a larger coordinated South African order that would incent local manufacturing and bring down capital expenditure and fuel prices. Bus manufacturers interviewed for this report include manufacturers of electric, gas, and ethanol buses. Those interviewed are willing to set up new or expand existing manufacturing plants in South Africa for committed orders (across municipalities) of approximately 300-500 buses. Local biofuel producers are waiting for government to provide a minimum volume of fuel off-take, for at least 5 years and of at least significant size (50+ buses) to invest in production volumes that will provide comfort to operators and sustainable jobs to the economy. SACN is focused on working with its members to achieve this kind of scale and impact across municipalities for either one or all three of the green transport technologies analysed (gas, electric, ethanol). Regardless of a municipality’s fuel choice, there will be other municipalities that make the same fuel choice and an aggregated purchase across many fleets will deliver better value for money to government than a once-off individual purchase by one fleet operator.",,,Johannesburg,ZAF,,SRID=4326;POINT (28.04363 -26.20227),2026469,has_abstract; all,Accelerating the Transition to Green Municipal Fleets,
17,zar5w,"Many major cities today are beginning to experience increasing water shortages. A major use of water is often in industrial production, and therefore its reduction should go a long way to correcting the situation. The composition of the whole local or regional industrial structure has a significant influence on this, with its combination of sectors of different resource-intensities varying in their scale of use. However, the form of industrial structure also has an influence on other aspects of city life – particularly its economic performance. Evaluating industrial structure, therefore, involves an optimization problem of, on the one hand, determining the appropriate proportions of various types of sectors that will best satisfy the objective of minimizing water consumption in the face of a range of economic and other constraints. Alternatively, it can be seen as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing economic benefit under a range of water use and other constraints.  In developing the optimization model, we first break down industrial water use into two objectives - (1) minimizing total consumption and (2) minimizing intensity (per unit) of consumption. Adding the economic objective of maximizing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), all three are then optimized retrospectively by a series of input-output analyses to evaluate the suitability of the industrial structure. The application of the model is demonstrated in a case study of Beijing that indicates that, while its industrial structures in 1992 and 2002 were far from optimal, the actual 2012 industrial structure was quite close to that determined by the model and augurs well for the city's future sustainable development.",,,Beijing,CHN,,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,has_abstract; all,Urban transformation optimization model: How to evaluate industrial structure under water resource constraints?,2018.0
18,pewjn,"Used cooking oil (UCO) can be considered either a waste product with negative effects on the environment or a resource if contributing to energy production. This thesis investigates the technical feasibility of integrating UCO into two bioenergy systems: anaerobic digestion (AD) for biogas production and transesterification process for biodiesel production. A comparative analysis of the case studies of Emilia Romagna and Missouri was conducted to develop alternative scenarios for the reuse and valorization of UCO and to identify potential policy interventions to stimulate its integration in bioenergy systems. The work demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of the substitution of energy crops with UCO with particular emphasis on the potential implications on land use. Moreover, results suggest that the introduction of UCO in the feeding mix could lead to significant land saving. The use of UCO would allow to maintain a stable production of energy along the year, to mitigate the environmental impact, and to ensure economic benefits for farmers. Although the substitution of ECs with UCO is technically feasible and economically viable, in both Countries a major constraint is represented by the current legislative framework that limits the collection and the utilization of UCO for anaerobic digestion. Policy interventions should be aimed at removing the barriers that currently limit UCO collection and reuse in bioenergy systems. They should focus also on the creation of public-private relationship aimed at facilitating UCO collection and disposal and on awareness rising to inform food chain stakeholders about the economic and environmental benefits of the integration of UCO in bioenergy systems.

19,9asns,"The building and construction sector accounted for over 35 % of the total final energy consumption and generated 40 % of the energy related greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Reducing energy consumption in buildings is critical to reduce the overall energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions to contribute to the major focus of a more sustainable and safer energy supply especially in the colder regions of the world. Hence, the main challenge lays within reducing the energy demands of existing building. The purpose of this master thesis project has been to enlighten and analyze how the differences in policies, regulations and other instrumental means affect the environmental footprint and energy consumptions of buildings in cold regions such as northern Japan and northern Norway. Simulations has been conducted as a part of a case study to further enlighten and visualize by figures the differences between Japan and Norway. In addition, an assessment of feasibility and potential measures that complies with cold climate aspects regarding energy efficiency is conducted. This has been executed as a collaboration project and exchange stay about green/sustainable buildings in colder regions of the world between UiT – The Arctic University of Norway in Narvik and Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, including an exchange stay in Sapporo. High energy consumption in buildings affect both Norway and Japan in the sense that measures must be taken to reduce the consumption and greenhouse gas emissions related to energy consumption. The energy consumption in Norway are mainly due to low energy prices and high heating demand. Energy consumption in Japan is mostly due to low thermal resistance of building components and a mixture of heating and cooling demand. The energy demand in Norway are largely covered by electricity based from renewable sources such as hydro power. Japan used to be based on electricity production from nuclear power, but after the earthquake in 2011 and the nuclear shutdown, forced Japan into using fossil fuel to cover the energy demand. Measures and strategies regarding the reduction of energy consumption in buildings derive from international societies such as the UN and the Paris Agreement. Until recently there has been little focus on existing buildings potential for energy efficiency compared to new buildings, which fall within the stricter energy requirement. Increased focus on renovation and rehabilitation is something both Japan and Norway emphasize. Buildings lifespan in Norway variates from 60 – 80 years. In Japan the life expectancy is estimated at 30 – 50 years. The potential of reducing energy efficiency in existing buildings is significant both in Japan and Norway A comprehensive literature review forms the basis of the results and comparisons that shows the difference between Japan and Norway, and it has been crucial to find the right aspects in terms of measures and strategies.

20,4twy5,"The global economy has shattered. The fossil fuel energies that propelled an industrial revolution are sunsetting, and the infrastructure built off these energies is barely clinging to life. Making matters worse, we now face catastrophic climate change from spewing industrial induced CO2 into the atmosphere for more than two centuries. The entropy bill for the industrial age has come due, with ominous and far‐reaching consequences for the continuation of life on Earth. What is happening to our world? The human race finds itself groping in a kind of twilight zone between a dying civilization on life support and an emerging civilization trying to find its legs. Meanwhile, old identities are deconstructing, while new identities are still too fragile to grasp. To understand our current plight and future prospects we need to step back and ask: what constitutes a fundamental change in the nature of civilization? The great changes in civilization occur when new energy regimes converge with new communication revolutions, creating new economic eras. The new forms of communication become the command and control mechanisms for structuring, organizing and managing the more complex civilizations made possible by these new energy regimes. For example, in the early modern age, print communication became the means to organize and manage the technologies, organizations and infrastructure of the coal, steam and rail revolution. It would have been impossible to administer the First Industrial Revolution using script and codex. Communication revolutions not only manage new, more complex energy regimes, but also change human consciousness in the process. Forager/hunter societies relied on oral communications and their consciousness was mythologically constructed. The great hydraulic agricultural civilizations were, for the most part, organized around script communication and steeped in theological consciousness. The First Industrial Revolution of the 19th century was managed by print communication and ushered in ideological consciousness. Electronic communication became the command and control mechanism for arranging the Second Industrial Revolution in the 20th century and spawned psychological consciousness. Today, we are on the verge of another seismic shift in communication technology and energy regimes. Distributed information and communication technologies are converging with distributed renewable energies, creating the infrastructure for a Third Industrial Revolution. In the 21st century, hundreds of millions of human beings will  transform their buildings into power plants to harvest renewable energies on‐site, store those energies in the form of hydrogen and share electricity with each other across continental inter‐grids that act much like the Internet. The open source sharing of energy will give rise to collaborative energy spaces—not unlike the collaborative social spaces on the Internet. In 2007, the European Parliament passed a written declaration committing itself to the Third Industrial Revolution economic game plan. That same year, the European Union committed its 27 member states to a 20‐20‐20 by 2020 initiative: a 20% increase in energy efficiency, a 20% reduction in global warming gas emissions, and the generation of 20% of its energy needs with renewable forms of energy, all by the year 2020 (based on 1990 levels). The new communication revolution not only organizes renewable energies, but also changes human consciousness. We are in the early stages of a transformation to biosphere consciousness. When each of us is responsible for harnessing the Earth’s renewable energy in the small swath of the biosphere where we dwell, but also realize that our survival and well‐being depends on sharing our energy with each other across continental land masses, we come to see our inseparable ecological relationship to one another. We are beginning to understand that we are as deeply connected with one another in the ecosystems that make up the biosphere as we are in the social networks of the Internet. This new understanding coincides with cutting edge discoveries in evolutionary biology, neuro‐cognitive science and child development, revealing that human beings are biologically predisposed to be empathic and that our core nature is not rational, detached, acquisitive, aggressive, and narcissistic, but affectionate, highly social, cooperative and interdependent. Homo sapien is giving way to homo empathicus. Historians tell us empathy is the social glue that allows increasingly individualized and diverse populations to forge bonds of solidarity across broader domains so that society can cohere as a whole. To empathize is to civilize. Empathy has evolved over history. In forager hunter societies, empathy rarely extended beyond tribal blood ties. In the great hydraulic agricultural age, empathy extended beyond blood ties to associational ties based on religious identification. Jews began to empathize with fellow Jews as a fictional extended family, Christians began empathizing with fellow Christians, Muslims with Muslims, etc. In the Industrial Age, with the emergence of the modern nation state, empathy extended once again, this time to people of like‐minded national identities. Dutch people began to empathize with other Dutch people, Americans with Americans, Japanese with Japanese, etc. Today, on the cusp of the Third Industrial Revolution, empathy is beginning to stretch beyond national boundaries to biosphere boundaries. We are coming to see the biosphere as our indivisible community and our fellow creatures as our extended evolutionary family. The realization that we are an empathic species, that empathy has evolved over history, and that we are as deeply interconnected in the biosphere as we are in the blogosphere, has profound implications for rethinking the future of the human journey. What is required now is a leap in human empathy, beyond national boundaries to biosphere boundaries. We need to create social trust on a global scale if we are to establish a seamless, integrated, just and sustainable planetary economy. That’s beginning to happen. Classrooms around the world are fast becoming laboratories for preparing young people for biosphere consciousness. Children are becoming aware that everything they do—the very way they live—leaves a carbon footprint, affecting the lives of every other human being, our fellow creatures, and the biosphere we cohabit. Students are beginning to take their empathic sensibilities to the biosphere itself, creating social trust on a global scale. We can no longer afford to limit our notion of extended family to national boundaries, with Europeans empathizing with fellow Europeans, Chinese with Chinese, and the like. A truly global biosphere economy will require a global empathic embrace. We will need to think as a species—as homo empathicus—and prepare the groundwork for an empathic civilization. When communities around the world take responsibility for stewarding their part of the biosphere and sharing the energy they generate with millions of others across continental land masses, we begin to extend the notion of family to all of the human race and our fellow creatures on Earth; we create biosphere consciousness.

21,4ujz6,"With the adoption of the Paris Agreement (PA), the world community has signalled a consensus about the long-term transformation that is required to avoid dangerous climate change – and a collective commitment to a path towards that transformation. This joint understanding is expressed in the global temperature goals (Article 2.2a) which require global greenhouse gas emissions to peak “as soon as possible” and “rapid reductions thereafter” to bring emissions and sinks into balance “in the second half of the century“ (Article 4.1 PA). Modern political constellations are not well-equipped to adopt policies effecting fundamental transformation over the course of several decades. Battling climate change thus presents a formidable governance challenge. To date, countries around the world have adopted different administrative and policy frameworks to structure and organise their climate change mitigation efforts. Some countries have passed dedicated, overarching climate laws (UK or Mexico) that regulate the decarbonisation of their economies over long periods of time, while others base their efforts on executive orders (e.g. Indonesia) or climate plans and other strategy documents (e.g. Germany, South Africa). Some countries are only working towards short-term objectives – or are driven primarily by other national objectives. Only very few have not adopted any policies addressed directly towards climate action – of those, most will do so as part of their contributions to the Paris Agreement. The transition towards a sustainable, climate friendly economy occurs at all levels of society – not just in national governments. Throughout the world, cities and regions hold considerable powers relevant to the decarbonisation pathway and have recognized their role and responsibility to take action. Many are leading the development of governance frameworks to prevent and adapt to climate change. Just like nation states and their governments, regions and cities are deepening their experience with domestic climate policies - an increasing number are specifically taking a long-term and transformational perspective. The Paris Agreement represents an acknowledgement of these existing long-term aspirations and frameworks at all levels of government. At the same time, it serves as a catalyst for further action, amplifying the move towards developing policy action for transformational change. Understanding better how administrations and communities can organise and manage the path towards a climate-friendly future is of key importance to understanding how the transformational change required by Paris can be delivered. This report seeks to contribute to the young field of study on long-term climate governance by showcasing examples. It provides insights as to which design elements long-term governance frameworks have proven or are likely to be effective in directing policies towards the Paris transformation.

22,b59ag,"Renewable energy is now an integral and growing part of our energy mix. Key national targets are instrumental in this uptake including the UK’s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 34% by the year 2020 and a binding European Union target requiring 15% of the UK’s total energy demand being sourced renewably in the same timeframe. In Kent a commitment has been made to a 60% reduction in carbon emissions on 1990 levels by 2030. Kent partners have already helped enable significant opportunities for renewable energy to be deployed across public, private and voluntary sectors in Kent. This currently produces around 640GWh of renewable energy annually (3.1% of our energy usage) with this figure increasing as new developments are installed. The growth is also good for our economy and it has been estimated that 19,600 people in Kent are currently employed in renewable and low carbon technology related industries, with this sector expanding nationally at around 5% per year. It is important that we continue to build on these successes and take further action to realise our potential as a County. The first step is to understand our resources and develop a co-ordinated approach to the generation of renewable energy. Kent County Council (KCC) commissioned AECOM to undertake a renewable energy resource and opportunity study for Kent. The study was financed through ClimactRegions, an INTERREG IVC project and completed in April 2012. Further details and the full study report are available on the KCC website. This plan takes forward actions recommended by the County Council’s Renewable Energy Select Committee and the priorities set out in the Kent Environment Strategy. It further builds on the actions identified in the AECOM study and the responses to a draft version of this plan circulated to stakeholders during the autumn of 2012. It is important to note that renewable energy is just one area of carbon reduction. Savings will also need to come through a range of other measures delivered on a local and national scale, including the improvement of buildings, de-carbonisation of the national electricity grid, and lower carbon transportation. Kent’s proposed approach to carbon reduction is set out in the Kent Environment Strategy. In Kent we have an excellent record for partnership working and this document continues that approach. A co-ordinated and shared approach to delivery can put Kent at the foreground of renewable energy development and drive our aspiration to be a truly low carbon County.

However, its dependency on crude oil, especially road transport, poses danger to the environment and human health, which is an issue that should not be neglected. In addition, with the increase in population comes the rise in transportation demand wherein currently, 75% of the European citizens reside in cities; hence, an upsurge in the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, unavoidable traffic congestion, and noise is expected as well (Borowik and Cywinski, 2016). In Europe, 94% of the transportation sector is reliant on oil and 84% of which is imported. European Union (EU) spends approximately €187 billion annually to meet the needs for transport. With its negative impacts, transportation, in general, accounts for around 23% of GHG emissions in Europe in 2015 and road transport is in fact responsible for the one-fifth of the total emissions. Shown in Figure 1.1 is the comparison of these emissions from 1990 to 2015. Therefore, due to its great contribution to the emissions; in reverse, it is also the key responsible for decarbonizing the European economy (European Commission, 2017). More specifically, the highest share of the GHG emissions among the different modes of transport is the road transport which accounts to 72.9% in 2015 and of which, the highest contributor is the cars with 44.4% from the total portion of road transport. With its continuous and uncontrollable growth, it can lead to serious diseases wherein 3.47 million early deaths are expected to occur because of air pollution in cities. Aside from the different harmful emissions, noise nuisance is also one of the main challenges that should be addressed as road traffic is mainly accountable for this. Inside urban areas, in 2012, approximately 73.5 million Europeans are exposed to noise levels above 55dB i.e. limit for daily exposure at daytime (European Environment Agency, 2017). Even outside urban areas, still, around 30 million people are affected by the effects of road traffic noise. Noise pollution can cause stress to the citizens which if not properly controlled, it can lead to severe diseases, for instance, premature death, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, hypertension, and annoyance (European Environment Agency, 2017). Shown in Figure 1.4 is the amount of people affected by noise levels above 55dB per mode of transport. The major challenges in the European transport are congestion especially for road and air traffic, oil dependency, GHG emissions, infrastructure quality, and competition (European Union, 2017). Some of these are discussed previously. Currently, the EU has been combating these problems through different policies. One of which is the White Paper on Transport which sets two goals that is aimed in reducing the emissions from transport (European Commission, 2017). • A 20% reduction from 2008 levels by 2030; and, • A 60% reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. Aside from this, different member states and other countries from outside EU, developed or developing, have participated and agreed upon the Paris Climate Accord which is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its main objective is to alleviate the GHG emissions by limiting the temperature change by only 2°C. In line with this, the EU also set target for new cars and vans. As for new cars, in 2021, a decrease of 40% in carbon dioxide emissions is expected in comparison with the amount recorded in 2005. On the other hand, as for the new vans, a 19% decrease is set in 2020 to compare with that of the levels in 2012. All these policies and objectives are assumed to increase the transport and fuel efficiency. Lastly, due to the widespread use of crude oil for transportation which is now getting depleted, cleaner fuels i.e. electricity, liquified natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), etc., are promoted in EU. However, it is difficult to penetrate the market with these alternative fuels because of the different challenges such as: • High cost of vehicles; • Low level of consumer acceptance; and, • Lack of recharging and refueling stations. Because of the low consumer acceptance, there is low demand on these vehicles; thus, resulting to expensive price of vehicles. For encouraging the society in supporting sustainable mobility and transport, one of the feasible ways in achieving this is through public transport. Due to the high carrying capacity of its different modes, compared to private transport, it shows to be the most reasonable candidate to aid in reducing congestion and harmful emissions by modifying the modal share i.e. car users to public transport. One possible solution in addressing these problems is through the electrification of public transport, specifically through the adaptation of hybrid-trolleybuses. Conventional trolleybuses are powered by electricity from the catenary and by fuel, in cases of road sections not equipped with wirings and of emergencies. On the other hand, this innovation, wherein the auxiliary power of the hybrid-trolleybuses is provided by battery packs, has zero emissions. Aside from producing zero emission, some other advantages of trolleybuses are listed below, as compared to the conventional buses, according to Zavada, Blašković Zavada, and Miloš (2010). • Favourable traction characteristic of electric motors. This means that at low speed the electric motor achieves high torque, and with speed increase the torque gets reduced. Therefore, these vehicles do not require special power transmission that would be used for torque transformation. They have a wide range of torque and speed regulation; • Electric motor power allows overloading, which in turn enables higher acceleration and easier uphill performance; • Electric braking reduces the load and wear of friction elements of the air brake, which reduces the vehicle maintenance requirements and costs; • Possibility of applying automation in all segments of vehicle operation; • Vehicle control is simple and easy. • Environmentally friendly transport mode since it does not emit harmful combustion gases and generates very low noise; • Higher energy efficiency. With these great features and advantages to the society, whether environmentally or economically, it would be beneficial to adapt this technology in different cities in Europe to help mitigate the GHG emissions and other challenges mentioned previously. Currently, there are over 300 trolleybus systems all over the globe. Some of which are in Esslingen, Germany, Beijing, China, and Bratislava, Slovakia. With the EU’s effort in promoting cleaner vehicles, this technology is becoming more popular, especially the hybrid-trolleybuses which are currently in demonstration and simulation stages in Eberswalde, Germany, Szeged, Hungary, and Gdynia, Poland. Trolleybuses, in general, have been proven to provide reliable mobility and minimize negative impacts such as air pollutants and noise. As a result, it also improves the quality of life.

25,rv8aw,"About three fourths of the global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions can be linked to energy use. This study aims to identify some driving forces behind the development of an energy system and how these forces can drive the development of a sustainable energy system. The study focuses on a single Swedish municipality, Halmstad. A secondary purpose has been to analyse some concepts of energy system forecasting. The energy system can be described as a sociotechnical system. Three related mechanisms discussed in the study are learning by doing, lock-in and technology clusters. To gain an understanding of the structure and development of the energy system, data and information regarding the import, production and consumption of energy was collected. To make the forecasts in this thesis, the method of logistic forecasting has been used. Halmstad’s generation capacity for electricity as of 2015 is 61 MW and consists primarily of wind power (40%), followed by hydropower (36%), combined heat and power generation (22%) and solar photovoltaics (2%). District heating is supplied by two plants: a 68 MW capacity waste-incineration plant, supplemented when needed by a natural gas and wood chip-fired 122 MW capacity plant. Non-renewable energy and electricity were the main energy carriers for end use, at 41% and 35% respectively, in 2013. The use of district heating and biofuels is increasing notably. Signs of lock-in can be seen with regard to the use of waste incineration. The benefits of learning by doing can be seen with regard to the installations of solar panels made by the municipality. Overall, progress toward a sustainable energy system has been made in some areas, e.g. the residential and public sectors and electricity generation, while others, e.g. the transport sector still have a long way to go.

26,bk9de,"We have been indeed witnessing increased environmental problems in the contemporary era of globalized capitalism and extension of markets to the environment. To such problems, numerous societal responses—local struggles, NGO’s, state-level or international initiatives—are being given; yet at the same time there exist an equally large amount of such problems where concerns are not pronounced (Ehrenberg 2011). Among the theoretical attempts in understanding societal responses (or lack thereof) to environmental issues, the Polanyian and Gramscian frameworks have been noteworthy—especially since the beginning of the 21st century (Adaman et al. 2003; special issue Geoforum on Gramscian Political Ecologies 2009; Ekers et al. 2013, Prudham 2013) Although a synthesis of these two names at a general level is available, thanks to the path-breaking work by Burawoy (2003), we do not have a well-worked theoretical synthesis of these two names as applied to environmental issues. It is the aim of this paper to provide a theoretical toolbox drawing upon both Polanyi and Gramsci in order to analyze society’s position vis-à-vis environmental issues. The contemporary political-economy landscape is marked with growing importance gained by environmental issues—at local, national as well as global levels— that are manifested in three inter-related aspects in particular. The first one corresponds to processes of commodification and marketization that are extended to the domains of natural resources and environmental management (Arsel and Büscher 2012; Castree 2008). Secondly, this is coupled with the fact that the environment is being intimately enrolled in states’ political agendas, not only in terms of policy-making, but also in the more integral sense of state-making (Whitehead et al. 2007; Asher and Ojeda 2009; Bridge 2014). Finally, social struggles around a wide range of environmental issues, waged at multiple scales from the global to the local, and even the individual, gain increased visibility and become forces that push forward transformations towards sustainability (Tamiotti and Finger 2001; Doherty and Doyle 2006). As the social struggles over the environment proliferate and diversify, it has become even more pertinent to develop theoretical and analytical perspectives that can help us better understand their multiplicity, multi-dimensionality and multiple trajectories, as well as their absences. Different disciplines and fields of study, including but not restricted political ecology, ecological economics, critical geography and environmental sociology, have offered important insights as to the economic, social, ecological and political processes that underlie specific struggles, and in which they are embedded, as well as to the discourses and strategies that diverse social actors (including institutions) deploy to advance their environmental claims. Our aim in this paper is to contribute to these studies by offering a coherent analytical framework to analyze environmental struggles that brings together the approaches of Gramsci and Polanyi. More specifically, we propose that Polanyi’s perspective of a double movement between the expansion of the self-regulating market and the counter-movements to resist its depredations, and Gramsci’s conceptualization of the dialectics of capitalist hegemony and counter-hegemony can be fruitfully combined to locate environmental struggles within the broader historical process of capitalist development and the diverse social struggles against its excesses. Building on Polanyi’s analysis of the market and the society (Polanyi 1944), environmental struggles can be understood as responses to the broader disembedding of the economy from the society and nature, and the institution of an economic logic in the governance of the environment through its commodification (Adaman et al. 2003). Polanyi was one of the first figures pinpointing the inherent tendency for capitalist production to undermine the ecological conditions on which it depends for its continued existence. By drawing attention to the dislocations and tensions that the disembedding of the economy from society and nature cause, Polanyi pointed out the conditions for the emergence of environmental struggles. However, Polanyi’s approach falls short of accounting for the ways the capitalist exploitation and commodification of nature are sustained and sanctioned. Moreover, although for Polanyi the resistance to the commodification of nature would mainly come from the old landed interest, in today’s world, environmental social movements and especially local initiatives have indeed assumed that very role; and for that matter his insights seem to remain partial in explaining the multiplicity of social actors that mobilize around environmental concerns, the different directions these mobilizations take, and the strategies and discourses they deploy. We argue that bringing Gramsci’s work on civil society, especially its dialectic relationship with the state, into a dialogue with the Polanyian framework promises to address these issues. Gramsci (1971) was mainly concerned with understanding how power relations are produced, maintained and challenged in capitalist societies. For him, civil society, understood not as separate from and opposed to the state, but organically connected to it, is not only the terrain on which hegemony is established, but also where it is contested (Buttigieg 2005), hence it contains both possibilities and constraints for social transformation. Gramsci conceptualizes social struggles in the sphere of civil society to challenge hegemony through the metaphor of “war of position”, which denotes the struggles aimed at “a disorganization of consent, a disruption of hegemonic discourses and practices” (Carroll and Ratner 1994: 6), as well as building of new conceptions of the world, and new social and economic relations. Although Gramsci’s own writings do not explicitly deal with the question of environment, building on his theoretical insights, it can be argued that environment is deeply implicated in the construction of hegemony, and environmental struggles are part of the “war of position” in civil society. Such a perspective will provide an elaborate framework that can shed light on the political dynamics at work in environmental struggles. We posit that the integrated Polanyi-Gramsci framework can provide a useful theoretical lens to analyze environmental struggles, on the basis that the former perspective explains why societies would limit the scope of the homogenizing rationality of self-regulating market economies, and the latter offers an articulate treatment of the ways in which state and society interact to shape the specific contents, forms and trajectories of environmental struggles. More specifically, Polanyi provides an explanation as to why various segments of societies are growing increasingly more frustrated about the commodification of nature, while Gramsci offers a systematic understanding of the power struggles on the terrain of state and society relations through which commodification of nature is legitimized, imposed, accepted and resisted. We argue that by combining both, we can better explain the political dynamics in environmental struggles, and examine their role in changing the unequal power relations within which decisions regarding the environment are made. While the main purpose of our paper is theoretical, we draw on selected examples of environmental struggles from around the world to demonstrate how the integrated Polanyi-Gramsci framework that we propose can shed light on their complex dynamics. Specifically, we discuss the struggle against a large-scale copper mine in the Intag valley of Ecuador, the conflicts triggered by the proliferation small-scale hydropower plants in Turkey, the struggle against privatization of water in Cochabamba, and the NO TAV movement against the building of a high-speed railway in the Susa Valley.",,,Cochabamba,BOL,,SRID=4326;POINT (-66.1568 -17.3895),900414,has_abstract; all,Developing a Polanyian-Gramscian Framework in Explaining Environmental Movements (or Lack Thereof),
