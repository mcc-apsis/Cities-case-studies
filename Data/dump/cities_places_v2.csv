0,WOS:000315491400033,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) are widely used for wastewater treatment, but may also be sources of greenhouse gas (GHG). This study focuses on comparing the GHG emissions from a vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) and a horizontal flow constructed wetland (HFCW) in the city of Tianjin, China. Two methods are used in this paper to estimate the indirect and direct GHG emissions. It is found that the VFCW emits 0.09, 1.34, and 3.31 kg equivalent CO2 (CO2 Eq.) to remove 1.00 m(3) wastewater, 1.00 kg COD, and 1.00 kg BOD in the studied life cycle, respectively, in contrast to 0.18, 2.10, and 5.42 kg CO2 Eq. for the HFCW. The results indicate that the adoption of VFCW is a more effective option with respect to GHG emissions when treating the same amount of pollutants. In addition, the operation phase which includes GHG emissions from water treatment process and energy consumption for pump dominates the GHG emissions. For different kinds of GHG from CWs, CO2 dominates the influence on climate change. The CH4 and N2O emissions should also deserve more attention due to their greater global warming potential. This paper further suggests that GHG emissions can be mitigated in the design, construction, and operation stages through some feasible measures. It would reduce GHG emissions in CWs by adopting hybrid CW system (e.g. HF-VF or VF-HF) or choosing suitable plant species which can mitigate GHG emissions. In addition, aeration could contribute to the control of GHG emissions from CWs.","Zhao, XH, Liu, L",3,Tianjin,CHN,10.1080/19443994.2012.734679,SRID=4326;POINT (117.17667 39.14222),11090314,"A comparative estimate of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from two types of constructed wetlands in Tianjin, China",2013
1,WOS:000350525300007,"This study attempts to present an urban road transportation strategy focusing on the mitigation of both GHGs emission and public health damage, taking Xiamen City as a case study. We developed a Public Health and GHGs Emission model to estimate the impacts of direct energy-consumption-related GHGs emissions and public health damage in Xiamen's road transportation strategies from 2008 to 2025, considering the environmental benefits and economic costs. Two scenarios were designed to describe future transportation strategies for Xiamen City, and mitigation potentials for both GHGs emission and public health costs were estimated from 2008 to 2025 under a series of options. The results show that enacting controls on private vehicles would be most effective to GHGs mitigation, while enacting controls on government and rental vehicles would contribute the most to NO2 and PM2.5 reductions. Compared with the Business as Usual scenario, the Integrated scenario would achieve about a 68% energy consumption reduction and save 0.23 billion yuan (95% CI: 0.16, 0.32) in health costs in 2025. It is clear that integrated and advisable strategies need to mitigate the adverse impacts of urban road vehicles on GHGs emissions and public health and economic costs, particularly in regions of rapid urbanization.

2,WOS:000422882500003,"Roofs are important components of buildings and can be designed and/or retrofitted with photovoltaic (PV) and green-roof (GR) systems to produce energy and to improve stormwater management. Traditionally, GRs and PVs have been viewed as direct competitors vying for the same roof space. However, with correct design, synergy effects arise when combining both technologies (GR-PV). In this paper, a probabilistic analysis is performed to examine the potential energy and carbon emissions of GR, PV, and GR-PV systems. The analysis demonstrates that a GR-PV system is a low-risk investment generating lower energy and carbon-emission payback time in comparison with separate GR and PV systems. Furthermore, the average of net energy of this technology is 7.3 and 1.3 times higher than separate GR and PV systems, respectively. In addition, the installation of GR-PV systems throughout the City of Toronto could supply 16% of the electricity by PVs and reduce 12% of energy demand (i.e., heating and cooling) by GRs. However, extensive modification of the electrical grid would be needed for efficient collection and transmission of PV-generated power.

3,WOS:000379270900033,"There is consensus among researchers and policy makers that households are major consumers of energy, which results in serious environmental and financial costs. However, low-income households in particular, are often energy insecure and spend a substantial proportion of their income on energy expenditure. Therefore, promoting household energy conservation is considered one of the key pathways to achieving sustainability, in both environmental and financial terms. This study examines the effectiveness of intervention strategies designed to promote energy conservation using data gathered among low-income households in Grahamstown, South Africa. A total of 103 households participated in the experimental study. Energy conservation strategies including print media, interactive face-to-face discussions and feedback were variably applied to different households. The results show that the interventions were more effective in promoting energy conservation when applied conjointly rather than separately. These results suggest that promoting pro-environmental behaviour even among low-income households is a possibility. Further, household energy reduction had significant relationships with participants' self-reported actions and personal values, but not with demographic characteristics. This study provides useful insights into the complex interplay of personal and situational factors that shape household energy consumption. The study underscores the important role that household-driven programmes could play in promoting sustainable energy use, with support from local (municipal) government. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Deliberative democracy forums serve to both better inform the public of the available options and provide a way for policymakers to assess support for proposed policies. This work uses a pilot study in Pittsburgh to generate hypotheses regarding how a deliberative democracy process affects residents' perceptions of and support for City-wide energy policies to address climate change. A convenience sample completed pre and post-surveys during a deliberative forum: ""Building a Resilient Pittsburgh: Climate Challenges and Opportunities"". The surveys focused on knowledge, perceptions, and opinions related to the existence of climate change as well as energy policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Results suggest that the forum was useful in shifting perceptions, but did not significantly influence objective knowledge or policy support.

5,WOS:000395488900047,"Due to the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution problem, traditional fossil energy is gradually being replaced by renewable energy in recent years. However, the introduction of renewable energy into power systems will lead to large voltage fluctuations and high capital costs. To solve these problems, an energy storage system (ESS) is employed into a power system to reduce total costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, this paper proposes a two-stage method based on a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and hybrid multi-objective particle swarm optimization (HMOPSO) to determine the optimal placements and sizes of ESSs in a transmission system. Owing to the uncertainties of renewable energy, a BPNN is utilized to forecast the outputs of the wind power and load demand based on historic data in the city of Madison, USA. Furthermore, power-voltage (P-V) sensitivity analysis is conducted in this paper to improve the converge speed of the proposed algorithm, and continuous wind distribution is discretized by a three-point estimation method. The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 30-bus system is adopted to perform case studies.

6,WOS:000329377800159,"Designing a future smart city (FSC) that copes with the reduction of CO2 has become one of the urgent tasks of the next 20 years. One promising approach to achieve FSC is to combine appropriate land use (compact city with energy efficient buildings and photovoltaic panels (PVs)), transportation (electric vehicles (EVs) and public transportation system) and energy systems (smart grid systems), because of the interaction between these elements. However, there are few models which simulate these elements in an integrated manner. This paper presents the concept of the integrated model, and shows the land use-energy part of the model created for the Tokyo metropolitan area, which is the largest Mega city in the world. Firstly, a spatially explicit land use model (urban economic model) is constructed for the study area, and the model is calibrated using existing statistical data. Secondly, possible future compact/dispersion city scenarios for the year 2050 are created using the model. Thirdly, intra-day dynamics (hourly) of electricity demand and supply from PVs, which is assumed to be installed to the roofs of all detached houses in the study area, under two urban scenarios is simulated. The obtained results suggest that [1] ""compact"" urban form may contribute to the reduction of electricity demand from the residential sector, but [2] PV-supply under the scenario may also be reduced because of the decreased share of detached houses. Hence in the compact city scenario, it is important to discuss the effective use of vacant areas in suburbs, which may be used for large PV installations, or be re-vegetated to mitigate urban heat island effects.

However, the consumer market has shown limited response to such policies. To upscale green building, it is crucial to understand the market demands for green apartments. This article employs a conjoint model to estimate the willingness to pay for green dwellings versus accessibility to metros and jobs and neighbourhood quality by different socio-economic groups in Nanjing, China. Results show that the socio-economic status of homebuyers determines their willingness to pay for green attributes. Only the rich are prepared to pay for green apartments to improve their living comfort.

While higher urban density may curb many of the problems associated with sprawl mainly by reducing vehicle travels and associated energy use, it can also limit on-site rooftop solar energy utilization due to more shade on rooftops in dense urban settings and less available rooftop area per person. Using travel survey, Geographic Information System (GIS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, we estimated vehicle energy use and rooftop solar potential in the City of San Francisco as a case study and calculated possible offsetting effects between vehicle energy consumption and rooftop solar potential. Given the prevalence of gasoline-based vehicles and today's solar photovoltaic (PV) panel efficiency, vehicle energy use per capita appears to exceed energy generated by rooftop solar PVs per capita across all density ranges, especially in lower density environments. At the point when electric cars and advanced, highly efficient solar PV panels penetrate the market, the results change based on the combination of different technological options. A significant reduction of energy consumption can be achieved through the immediate and rapid spread of energy efficient technologies in vehicles and solar PVs along with the long-term effect from gradual urban densification.","Ko, YK, Jang, KT, Radke, JD",0,San Francisco,USA,10.1080/15568318.2016.1274807,SRID=4326;POINT (-122.41942 37.77493),864816,"Toward a solar city: Trade-offs between on-site solar energy potential and vehicle energy consumption in San Francisco, California",2017

By requiring owners to measure and disclose their energy use, these policies are intended to transform the market for energy-efficient investments in existing buildings. To improve future policy efforts, two critical questions are: first, how much energy do these policies save? and second, what particular aspects of these policies are most effective? To answer these questions, this study explores how different aspects of these policies were phased-in to different groups of buildings over the first four years of the City of New York's benchmarking ordinance. By applying a novel difference-in-differences strategy, we can causally attribute observed declines in energy consumption to specific owner behaviors and policy mechanisms. Our analysis indicates that in comparison with the control group and before the policies were implemented in 2011, total disclosure of both energy use and Energy Star together can be credited with a 6% reduction in building energy use intensity (EUI) three years later and a 14% reduction in EUI four years later. Disclosure of Energy Star scores decreased building EUI by 9% three years later and 13% four years later.

11,WOS:000391611000027,"This study applied the interprovincial input-output model to calculate the carbon footprint of 30 provinces and the interprovincial transfer of embodied CO2 emissions in China. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the carbon footprints and the per capita carbon footprints of these provinces. The provinces with large carbon footprints are the economically developed provinces, while those with high per capita carbon footprints are the provinces that include central cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, and the areas with abundant resources and heavy industry bases. The spatial transfer of embodied CO2 emissions in China occurs as follows: from economically developed provinces to provinces with rich resources and intensive heavy industries, from southern provinces to northern provinces, and from coastal provinces to inland provinces. To meet the demand of the coastal, southern, and economically developed provinces, the inland, northern provinces have assumed responsibility for most CO2 emissions. Thus, the domain decomposition of the responsibility for the reduction of CO2 emissions in China must take into account the spatial transfer of embodied CO2 emissions. The responsibility of producers and consumers should be integrated when establishing the indexes for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the various provinces of China. To design a comprehensive burden-sharing scheme for CO2 emissions, especially with respect to the carbon tax, the consumer principle needs to be considered; coastal provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong and southern economically developed provinces are obliged to assume greater responsibility for the reduction of CO2 emissions.","Wu, SM, Lei, YL, Li, ST",2,Shanghai; Beijing,CHN; CHN,10.1007/s11069-016-2585-5,SRID=4326;POINT (121.45806 31.22222); SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),22315474; 11716620,Provincial carbon footprints and interprovincial transfer of embodied CO2 emissions in China,2017

Mean annual emissions of CO2 in the period 2012-2014 (39.1 +/- 2.4 ktons km(-2) yr(-1)) and CO (89 +/- 16 tons km 2 yr(-1)) were consistent (within 1 and 5% respectively) with values from the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, but measured CH4 emissions (72 +/- 3 tons km(2) yr(-1) were over two-fold larger than the inventory value. Seasonal variability was large for CO with a winter to summer reduction of 69 %, and monthly fluxes were strongly anti-correlated with mean air temperature. The winter increment in CO emissions was attributed mainly to vehicle cold starts and reduced fuel combustion efficiency. CO2 fluxes were 33% higher in winter than in summer and anti-correlated with mean air temperature, albeit to a lesser extent than for CO. This was attributed to an increased demand for natural gas for heating during the winter. CH4 fluxes exhibited moderate seasonality (21% larger in winter), and a spatially variable linear anti-correlation with air temperature. Differences in resident population within the flux footprint explained up to 90% of the spatial variability of the annual CO2 fluxes and up to 99% for CH4. Furthermore, we suggest that biogenic sources of CH4, such as wastewater, which is unaccounted for by the atmospheric emissions inventories, make a substantial contribution to the overall budget and that commuting dynamics in and out of central business districts could explain some of the spatial and temporal variability of CO2 and CH4 emissions. To our knowledge, this study is unique given the length of the data sets presented, especially for CO and CH4 fluxes. This study offers an independent assessment of ""bottom-up"" emissions inventories and demonstrates that the urban sources of CO and CO2 are well characterized in London. This is however not the case for CH4 emissions which are heavily underestimated by the inventory approach.

To reduce the region's energy consumption and carbon emission, we studied energy flow process in this region. The previous research on energy flow is concentrated on a single scale, with little multi-scale integration. In this study, based on framework of urban metabolism, we used ecological network analysis method to study the region's energy metabolism and ecological relationship among nodes at two scales: in 3-node and 13-node models of the agglomeration. The integral (direct + indirect) energy consumption in the 3-node model first increased, then decreased, from 2002 to 2010; consumption in the 13-node model first decreased, then increased. The direct and integral energy flows showed that Hebei provided the most energy to Beijing in the 3-node network; in the 13-node network, Tangshan provided the most energy to the other 12 cities. In terms of the ecological relationships among the nodes, the 13-node model showed proportionally more competition relationships than the 3-node model.

In this study the expected population exposed to air pollutants was estimated under the different energy use scenarios by the year 2010, 2020 and 2030, respectively, in the urban area of Beijing, China. The concentration-response functions between air pollutants and the health endpoints were established using meta-analysis and regression models.

We used daily measurements of particulate matter less than 10 gm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and sulphate dioxide (SO2) as air pollution indicators. The percentage of population exposed to higher level of PM10 will be decreased significantly under the clean energy use scenario than that under the Baseline Scenario (i.e., business-as-usual scenario).

In most cases, high CH4 concentrations seemed be sustained by allochtonous sources such as the sewage network and polluted rivers, especially under high accumulated precipitation conditions. In the most stratified area, at the inner and centre of the Bay, CH4 concentrations were not significantly higher in bottom hypoxic waters than in surface waters, suggesting that CH4 diffusion from these sediments was modest, due to the prevalence of sulphate reduction over methanogenesis. Our calculated annual air-sea fluxes (565-980 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) are well above those of most estuaries worldwide, showing that urban pollution can be an important source of CH4 to the coastal waters and even more significant than the presence of organic-rich environments, like salt marshes and mangroves. Comparing the greenhouse gas emissions in terms of CO2-equivalent, CH4 emissions reduced the net CO2 sink in Guanabara Bay by 16%.","Cotovicz, LC, Knoppers, BA, Brandini, N, Poirier, D, Santos, SJC, Abril, G",2,Bay Village,USA,10.1002/lno.10298,SRID=4326;POINT (-81.92207999999999 41.48477),15402,"Spatio-temporal variability of methane (CH4) concentrations and diffusive fluxes from a tropical coastal embayment surrounded by a large urban area (Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)",2016
19,WOS:000299145100013,"Healthcare waste streams are persistent waste streams and which are consistently increasing in volume and complexity in developed and developing countries. When poorly managed, through inappropriate health care waste management systems, they can cause adverse effects to human health and the environment. This paper presents an evaluation of health care waste management systems in Cameroon, based on a survey of five health care facilities in the Southwestern Region of Cameroon. It is established that health care waste collection and handling systems including containers and bins for segregated wastes are generally in a poor state. A proportion of the waste stream is disposed of in open dumps in combination with municipal solid wastes while some are disposed of in incinerators which are often poorly designed. The waste stream is complex and heterogeneous with an average waste generation rate estimated at 4.4.9 kg/day equivalent to over 16 tonnes/annum comprising 49%, 16% and 14% of general, infectious and sharps respectively for a typical Health Care Facility in Buea which is a medium densely populated town. There is the potential to recover materials from this waste stream. if adequate waste management systems are developed and implemented. Separately recovering the uncontaminated general waste stream for a secondary market ultimately contributes to resource efficiencies and conservation of scarce natural resources. Reducing the waste quantities being incinerated results in less potential for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and greenhouse gases to be released into the environment, thus contributing to global environmental benefits through climate change mitigation and pollution reduction. The study establishes that the little attention given to medical waste management results from a lack of an integrated approach to policy making at the highest level of decision-making. There is the need for legislation to allow for a more defined roles and responsibilities for health care personnel responsible for the handling and disposal of the waste streams at the point of generation in the health care facilities. Overall, there is the need to formulate more sustainable health care waste management legislation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The consumption of non-renewable energy is one of the most important sources of the CO2 emissions, which cause climate changes. This paper presents a study on the energy system modelling towards renewable energy and low carbon development for the city of Beijing. The analysis of energy system modelling is organized in two steps to explore the alternative renewable energy system in Beijing. Firstly, a reference energy system of Beijing is created based on the available data in 2014. The EnergyPLAN, an energy system analysis tool, is chosen to develop the reference energy model. Secondly, this reference model is used to investigate the alternative energy system for integrating renewable energies. Three scenarios are developed towards the energy system of Beijing in 2030, which are: (i) reference scenario 2030, (ii) BAU (business as usual) scenario 2030, and (iii) RES (renewable energies) scenario 2030. The 100% renewable energy system with zero CO2 emissions can be achieved by increasing solar energy, biomass and municipal solid waste (MSW) and optimizing heating system. The primary fuel consumption is reduced to 155.9 TWh in the RES scenario, which is 72% of fuel consumption in the reference scenario 2030. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we present results from a collaborative design project carried out with planning officials from the city of Jinan (population 3.4 million), for the Luokou district, a 3.1 km(2) (1.2 mi(2)) area to the north of the CBD that is expected to house 100,000-130,000 people by 2020. By integrating sustainable building design, land use, urban design, and transportation, our proposal identified opportunities for improving energy efficiency that might have been overlooked by considering buildings and transportation separately. Mixed land uses and walkable neighborhoods were proposed along with highly differentiated street designs, intended to carry different traffic loads and prioritize diverse travel modes. Street widths and building heights were adjusted to maximize the potential for passive solar heating and daylight use within buildings. The district's environmental performance, analyzed using building energy evaluation and traffic micro simulation models, showed that the design would reduce energy loads by over 25% compared to business as usual. While the proposal complied with national and local policies, and had far better energy performance than conventional designs, the proposal ultimately was not accepted by local officials because initial costs to the developers were higher than for conventional designs.","Shirgaokar, M, Deakin, E, Duduta, N",1,Jinan,CHN,10.3390/en6020646,SRID=4326;POINT (116.99722 36.66833),4335989,"Integrating Building Energy Efficiency with Land Use and Transportation Planning in Jinan, China",2013

The extent of urban production and urban lifestyles has become one of the main drivers for China's CO2 emissions. To analyze drivers of CO2 emissions we use a consumption-based accounting approach that allocates all emissions along the production chain to the product and place of final consumption, whereas a production-based approach would allocate all emissions to the place of origin. In this study, we focus on the spatial distribution of production activities leading to CO2 emissions across China as a consequence of final consumption in four Chinese mega cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing. Urban consumption not only causes a large amount of emissions within its territory, but also imposes even much more emissions to its surrounding provinces via interregional supply chains. Results show that more than 48% of CO2 emissions related to goods consumed in Chongqing and more than 70% for Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin occurred outside of the respective city boundary. In addition to the usual focus on efficiency, our analysis adds insights into the causes of CO2 emissions by looking at the drivers and types of consumption. Addressing consumption patterns in China's cities is critical for China's low carbon development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

24,WOS:000402398900004,"Urban expansion increases the need for, and pressure on, green areas. Reforestation projects in the rural-urban fringe represent an opportunity for enhancing the environmental quality of peri-urban spaces and a means to contribute to cities carbon neutrality policies. Yet, relatively little information exists regarding the long term (10-25 years) survival and growth rate in urban and peri-urban plantations. This paper reports and discusses the results achieved by a reforestation in the peri-urban space of Rome (Italy), 25 years after its establishment. The plantation has been periodically surveyed between 6 and 24 years of age by means of continuous inventories, with the aim of monitoring growth dynamics. Permanent sample plots have been investigated and stratified by tree species composition (broadleaves vs. conifers, single vs. multispecies) for data analysis. On the whole, plantations show suitable results in terms of rate of growth, carbon storage and uptake, especially in coniferous and mixed stands. The average stand volume of the forest plantation, currently ranges from one-and-a third to one-and-a-half times the average values estimated for natural high forest stands of the same age and species groups at country level. The species groups exhibit differential growth patterns over the observed period, that are mainly due to differences in the ecological traits of the planted trees. Ten years after the establishment, the average annual value of carbon uptake in conifer and mixed species group exceeds 10 Mg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1), a figure corresponding to 4 times the value of deciduous broadleaves (oaks and other species) and 1.5 times the value of evergreen oaks. Twenty years after the establishment, the average annual carbon uptake peaks to 25 Mg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1) in the mixed species group, exceeds 15 Mg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1) in the conifers, and ranks between 6 and 12.5 Mg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1) in the groups dominated by broadleaved species. Overall with a surface area just under 300 ha, the carbon uptake level of the Castel di Guido reforestation allows to offset the 0.04% of CO2 emissions of the city of Rome. Although the spatial coexistence of even-aged plantation blocks characterized by a range of ecological traits, is expected to ensure a more continuous carbon sequestration, being less susceptible to damage of any kind, the current lack of silvicultural management may also lead to degradation processes, by triggering e.g. fuel accumulation and, by consequence, forest fires. In this line, recommendations are provided in order to improve the ecological and functional efficiency of the investigated reforestation. The field experiment demonstrates, ultimately, the capability of the continuous forest inventory to take the pulse over several decades of tree species performance and carbon uptake levels in urban and peri-urban reforestations.","Ferrari, B, Corona, P, Mancini, LD, Salvati, R, Barbati, A",0,Rome,ITA,10.1007/s11056-017-9580-x,SRID=4326;POINT (12.51133 41.89193),2318895,Taking the pulse of forest plantations success in peri-urban environments through continuous inventory,2017

Our model included changes in GHGE due to the effect of creating an AHHVG for five components: reduction of lawn area due to replacement by the AHHVG; reduction of vegetables purchased from the conventional agrifood system due to replacement by vegetables produced in the AHHVG; reduction in amount of greywater exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to irrigate the AHHVG; reduction in amount of household organic waste exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to composting at the household level for application to the AHHVG; and composting organic household waste for use in the AHHVG. We found that AHHVGs could reduce emissions by over 2 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) vegetable, but that results were sensitive to the range of values for the key variables of yield and alternative methods for processing household organic waste. In our baseline scenario (50% of singlefamily households with an 18.7 m(2) AHHVG, providing 50% of their vegetable consumption), AHHVGs contributed 3.3% of the GHGE reduction goals of unincorporated Santa Barbara County for 2020, 0.5% of the goals for the City of Santa Barbara for 2050, and by extrapolation, 7.8% of the goals for California for 2020.

Present study was aimed to investigate the concentration of fugitive PAHs in the environment (outdoor and indoor settings), associated probabilistic health risk assessment in the exposed population, and possible linkage between fuel consumption patterns and PAHs emissions in twin cities (Rawalpindi and Islamabad) of Pakistan. Results showed that the mean PAHs concentrations (air: 2390 pg m(-3); dust: 167 ng g(-1)) in the indoor environment were higher than that of the outdoor environment (air: 2132 pg m(-3); dust: 90.0 ng g(-1)). Further, the source apportionment PCA-MLR receptor model identified diesel and gasoline combustion as the primary PAHs sources in the urban and sub-urban settings. Estimated life cancer risk (LCR) potential via inhalation to indoor PAHs was higher with a probability of 2.0 cases per 10,000 inhabitants as compared to outdoor exposure. Incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) model from exposure to dust bound PAHs showed risk in the order of ingestion > dermal > inhalation for various exposure pathways. Likewise, estimated daily intake (EDI) model reflects that PAHs in surface dust enter into the human body mainly through the respiratory system because EDI for breathing was reported higher than that of oral intake.

Thus, attention has been paid towards restraining the growth of carbon emissions and minimizing potential impact on the global climate. Currently there has also been increasing recognition that the urban forms, which refer to the spatial structure of urban land use as well as transport system within a metropolitan area, can have a wide variety of implications for the carbon emissions of a city. However, studies are limited in analyzing quantitatively the impacts of different urban forms on carbon emissions. In this study, we quantify the relationships between urban forms and carbon emissions for the panel of the four fastest-growing cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou) using time series data from 1990 to 2010. Firstly, the spatial distribution data of urban land use and transportation network in each city are obtained from the land use classification of remote sensing images and the digitization of transportation maps. Then, the urban forms are quantified using a series of spatial metrics which further used as explanatory variables in the estimation. Finally, we implement the panel data analysis to estimate the impacts of urban forms on carbon emission. The results show that, (1) in addition to the growth of urban areas that accelerate the carbon emissions, the increase of fragmentation or irregularity of urban forms could also result in more carbon emissions; (2) a compact development pattern of urban land would help reduce carbon emissions; (3) increases in the coupling degree between urban spatial structure and traffic organization can contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions; (4) urban development with a mononuclear pattern may accelerate carbon emissions.

Here, we present a conceptual framework quantifying how urbanization influences the ecosystem services in a typical city (Nanjing) of China. Between 2000 and 2010, we separated the city into three urbanization categories (developing urban, developed urban, and rural areas) and quantified the status of six critical ecosystem services (food supply, carbon sequestration, soil water storage, air pollution removal, habitat suitability, and recreation potential). Our results show that urbanization significantly impacted all ecosystem services, with detected changes in ecosystem services being spatially heterogeneous due to urban expansion and population mobility. Developed areas contained greater amounts of green infrastructure, which improved carbon storage and reduced air pollution. In contrast, the rapid expansion of urban and industrial land in developing urban areas led to lower food supply, carbon sequestration, soil water storage, and habitat suitability. The expansion of rural residential areas led to lower soil water storage, carbon sequestration, and food supply, while greater amounts of abandoned cropland resulted in increased carbon sequestration, but decreased food supply in rural areas. Analysis of the interactions between pairs of ecosystem services identified urbanization development problems, including abandoned cropland and the expansion of rural residential land. Lastly, we proposed four key urban planning measures to mitigate the loss of ecosystem services during rapid urbanization. Acquiring quantitative knowledge about how rapid urbanization drives changes to ecosystem changes may help guide sustainable urban planning with respect to ecosystem service use, urban development, and human welfare benefits.

Even though alternative fuel vehicles such as all-electric vehicles will be the best solution in the future, mitigating emissions by existing gasoline vehicles is an alternative countermeasure in the near term. The aim of this study is to predict the vehicle CO2 emission per kilometer and determine an eco-friendly path that results in minimum CO2 emissions while satisfying travel time budget. The vehicle CO2 emission model is derived based on the theory of vehicle dynamics. Particularly, the difficult-to-measure variables are substituted by parameters to be estimated. The model parameters can be estimated by using the current probe vehicle systems. An eco-routing approach combining the weighting method and k-shortest path algorithm is developed to find the optimal path along the Pareto frontier.

Specifically, the benefit trade-off between CO2 emission reduction and the travel time buffer is discussed by carrying out sensitivity analysis in a network-wide scale.

32,WOS:000319774800014,"Many regulating ecosystem services exhibit non-excludability and non-rivalry characteristics akin to public goods. This makes it unlikely that such regulating ecosystem services will attract a price in the marketplace. Policymakers, therefore, find difficulties in determining a correct economic valuation for regulating ecosystem services, with potentially severe consequences for aligning policy for ecosystem service provision with public preferences for service delivery. This research used a choice modelling approach to estimate public preferences for delivery of two regulating ecosystem services; reductions in the flood risk to the British city of York (implemented by filling in drainage ditches in peat moorland further up the catchment), and a reduction in CO2 emissions (implemented by planting Poplar trees for biomass either locally in the study area or elsewhere in the UK). The choice experiment presented respondents with options providing different levels of CO2 reduction, implemented locally or nationally, and different levels of flood risk reduction, at a range of different prices, with a tax as the payment vehicle. Subsequent analysis with latent class (LC) models showed considerable heterogeneity of preference among respondents, particularly with regard to the location of tree planting for CO2 reduction. One LC segment showed a significant preference for achieving a high level CO2 reduction through national, as opposed to local tree planting, potentially indicating the existence of NIMBYism. The same LC segment displayed a preference for moderate reductions in the flood risk to York, even though this would deliver no personal benefit for a substantial proportion of the segment. This could, therefore, indicate altruistic behaviour towards geographically proximate beneficiaries.","Drake, B, Smart, JCR, Termansen, M, Hubacek, K",4,York,GBR,10.1007/s10113-011-0252-7,SRID=4326;POINT (-1.08271 53.95763),144202,Public preferences for production of local and global ecosystem services,2013

The algorithm used is based on a mathematical graph theory, specifically on a solution to the Chinese postman problem, using two types of optimization: 1) optimization of the entire plan of the winter service and 2) optimization of the completed part of the planned service. The winter service includes plowing and a salting process that requires refilling the salt reservoirs on the vehicles. In our real-world case only one base was available for refilling the salt reservoirs, so two additional optimization approaches were evaluated: a) optimization of the traversals of plans starting form a single base and b) using proposed three additional recharge bases distributed across the city and recharging at the closest base when needed. The results of the optimization suggested a reduction of route length by 28.3% when executing the entire plan. When considering a redistribution of the salting material at three other locations, our estimation has showed that additional savings up to 9.8% could be achieved regarding to the selection of those locations. Less routes traveled consequently leads to a reduction of resource usage (diesel) and lower CO2 emissions. When executing 15 plans in a single winter service campaign, 210 L less diesel was used, resulting in 1.362 t less CO2 emissions per campaign, representing a reduction of 30%. Our model was initially based on real-life snow plowing processes and their statistics; where possible we used real -life data to configure the model, such as the salting material, loading times, the quantity of salting material distributed per km, the characteristics of the plowing vehicle, etc. Due to the heavy conditions during the execution of planned winter services, plans sometimes had to be readjusted on the go. Combining optimization with custom software for real-time execution, planning and service monitoring, assisted from the cloud, provided even more deterministic cost and environmental management, and gave further opportunity for optimization processes.

35,WOS:000270120000002,"Optimization of combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems operation commonly focuses only on energy cost. Different algorithms have been developed to attain optimal utilization of CCHP units by minimizing the energy cost in CCHP systems operation. However, other outcomes resulting from CCHP operation such as primary energy consumption and emission of pollutants should also be considered during CCHP systems evaluation as one would expect these Outcomes can be subject to regulation. This paper presents an optimization of the operation of CCHP systems for different climate conditions based on operational cost, primary energy consumption (PEC), and carbon dioxide emissions (CDE) using an optimal energy dispatch algorithm. The results for the selected cities demonstrate that in general there is not a common trend among the three optimization modes presented in this paper since optimizing one parameter may reduce or increase the other two parameters. The only cities that show reduction of PEC while also reducing the CDE are Columbus, MS: Minneapolis, MN; and Miami, FL. For these cities the operational cost always increases when compared to the reference case consisting of using a vapor/compression cycle for cooling and natural gas for heating. On the other hand, for San Francisco and Boston, CCHP systems increase the CDE. In general, if CCHP systems increase the cost of operation, as long as energy savings and reduction of emissions are guaranteed, the implementation of these systems should be considered.

Building a community with amenable walk and bicycle facilities asks for smart planning and investments. It is critical to investigate the impact of infrastructure building or expansion on the overall walk and bicycle mode usage prior to making investment choices utilizing public tax money. This research developed a high performance agent-based model to support investment decisions that allows to assess the impact of changes in walk-bike infrastructures at a fine spatial resolution (e.g., block group level). We built the agent based model (ABM) in Repast-HPC platform and calibrated the model using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Simulation (SPSA) technique. The ABM utilizes data from a synthetic population simulator that generates agents with corresponding socio-demographic characteristics, and integrates facility attributes regarding walking and bicycling such as sidewalk width and total length bike lane into the mode choice decision making process. Moreover, the ABM accounts for the effect of social interactions among agents who share identical home and work geographic locations. Finally, GIS-based maps are developed at block group resolution that allows examining the effect of walk-bike infrastructure related investments. The results from New York City case study indicate that infrastructure investments such as widening sidewalk and increasing bike lane network can positively influence the active transportation mode choices.

37,WOS:000295095100008,"1. Despite urbanization being a major driver of land-use change globally, there have been few attempts to quantify and map ecosystem service provision at a city-wide scale. One service that is an increasingly important feature of climate change mitigation policies, and with other potential benefits, is biological carbon storage. 2. We examine the quantities and spatial patterns of above-ground carbon stored in a typical British city, Leicester, by surveying vegetation across the entire urban area. We also consider how carbon density differs in domestic gardens, indicative of bottom-up management of private green spaces by householders, and public land, representing top-down landscape policies by local authorities. Finally, we compare a national ecosystem service map with the estimated quantity and distribution of above-ground carbon within our study city. 3. An estimated 231 521 tonnes of carbon is stored within the above-ground vegetation of Leicester, equating to 3.16 kg C m(-2) of urban area, with 97.3% of this carbon pool being associated with trees rather than herbaceous and woody vegetation. 4. Domestic gardens store just 0.76 kg C m(-2), which is not significantly different from herbaceous vegetation landcover (0.14 kg C m(-2)). The greatest above-ground carbon density is 28.86 kg C m(-2), which is associated with areas of tree cover on publicly owned/managed sites. 5. Current national estimates of this ecosystem service undervalue Leicester's contribution by an order of magnitude. 6. Synthesis and applications. The UK government has recently set a target of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, from 1990 levels, by 2050. Local authorities are central to national efforts to cut carbon emissions, although the reductions required at city-wide scales are yet to be set. This has led to a need for reliable data to help establish and underpin realistic carbon emission targets and reduction trajectories, along with acceptable and robust policies for meeting these goals. Here, we illustrate the potential benefits of accounting for, mapping and appropriately managing above-ground vegetation carbon stores, even within a typical densely urbanized European city.","Davies, ZG, Edmondson, JL, Heinemeyer, A, Leake, JR, Gaston, KJ",135,Leicester,GBR,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02021.x,SRID=4326;POINT (-1.13169 52.6386),339239,Mapping an urban ecosystem service: quantifying above-ground carbon storage at a city-wide scale,2011
38,WOS:000292670800027,"Low Impact Development (LID) is part of a new paradigm in urban water management that aims to decentralize water storage and movement functions within urban watersheds. LID strategies can restore ecosystem functions and reduce runoff loadings to municipal water pollution control facilities (WPCF). This research examines the avoided energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of select LID strategies using life cycle assessment (LCA) and a stochastic urban watershed model. We estimate annual energy savings and avoided GHG emissions of 7.3 GJ and 0.4 metric tons, respectively, for a LID strategy implemented in a neighborhood in New York City. Annual savings are small compared to the energy and GHG intensity of the LID materials, resulting in slow environmental payback times. This preliminary analysis suggests that if implemented throughout an urban watershed, LID strategies may have important energy cost savings to WPCF, and can make progress towards reducing their carbon footprint.

FSSOM integrates techniques of SVR (support vector regression), Monte Carlo simulation, and FICMP (fractile interval chance constrained mixed-integer programming). In FSSOM, uncertainties expressed as fuzzy boundary intervals and random variables can be effectively tackled. In addition, SVR coupled Monte Carlo technique is used for predicting the peak-electricity demand. The FSSOM is applied to planning EPS for the City of Qingdao, China. Solutions of electricity generation pattern to satisfy the city's peak demand under different probability levels and p-necessity levels have been generated. Results reveal that the city's electricity supply from renewable energies would be low (only occupying 83% of the total electricity generation). Compared with the energy model without considering peak demand, the FSSOM can better guarantee the city's power supply and thus reduce the system failure risk. The findings can help decision makers not only adjust the existing electricity generation/supply pattern but also coordinate the conflict interaction among system cost, energy supply security, pollutant mitigation, as well as constraint violation risk.

In Boston and eastern Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) offers subway, bus, ferry, and commuter rail service to provide options to personal automobile use and thereby reduce highway congestion, improve air quality, and reduce energy consumption. In recent years, scholarly research has suggested that railroads in the city represent an overlooked rail transit opportunity for inner-city mobility. The MBTA's Fairmount Commuter Rail Line passes through some of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the region, yet residents seldom use the line for travel. Instead, Fairmount corridor residents tend to use private automobiles and the overcrowded bus and rapid transit network to travel to downtown Boston. This report documents the methods, findings, and recommendations of a 14-month planning study to investigate strategies that would increase the attractiveness and utility of MBTA services on this underutilized line.

Rapid urbanization combined with climate change and poor governance often results in significant increase of flood risk, especially for coastal communities. Wave overtopping and wave run-up are the key mechanisms for monitoring the results of coastal flooding and as such, significant efforts are currently focusing on their predicting. In this paper, an integrated methodology is proposed, accounting for wave overtopping and wave run-up under extreme wave scenarios caused by storm surges. By taking advantage of past and future climatic projections of wind data, a downscaling approach is proposed, utilizing a number of appropriate numerical models than can simulate the wave propagation from offshore up to the swash zone. The coastal zone of Rethymno in Greece is selected as a case study area and simulations of wave characteristics with the model SWAN for the period 1960-2100 in the offshore region are presented. These data are given as boundary conditions to further numerical models (MIKE21 PMS and HD) in order to investigate the spatial evolution of the wave and the hydrodynamic field in intermediate and shallow waters. Finally, the calculated wave height serves as input to empirical formulas and time dependent wave propagation models (MIKE21 BW) to estimate the wave run-up and wave overtopping (EurOtop).

The system performance of solar desiccant cooling strongly depends on the input parameters associated with the system components, such as the solar collector, storage tank and backup heater, etc. In order to understand the implications of different design parameters on the system performance, this study has conducted a parametric analysis on the solar collector area, storage tank volume, and backup heater capacity of a solid solar desiccant cooling system for an office building in Brisbane, Australia climate. In addition, a parametric analysis on the outdoor air humidity ratio control set-point which triggers the operation of the desiccant wheel has also been investigated. The simulation results have shown that either increasing the storage tank volume or increasing solar collector area would result in both increased solar fraction (SF) and system coefficient of performance (COP), while at the same time reduce the backup heater energy consumption. However, the storage tank volume is more sensitive to the system performance than the collector area. From the economic aspect, a storage capacity of 30 m(3)/576 m(2) has the lowest life cycle cost (LCC) of $405,954 for the solar subsystem.

However, the energy savings and environmental benefits are affected greatly by ambient air pollution in China. Here we estimate the NV potential of all major Chinese cities based on weather, ambient air quality, building configuration, and newly constructed square footage of office buildings in the year of 2015. In general, little NV potential is observed in northern China during the winter and southern China during the summer. Kunming located in the Southwest China is the most weather-favorable city for natural ventilation, and reveals almost no loss due to air pollution. Building Energy Simulation (BES) is conducted to estimate the energy savings of natural ventilation in which ambient air pollution and total square footage at each city must be taken into account. Beijing, the capital city, displays limited per-square-meter saving potential due to the unfavorable weather and air quality for natural ventilation, but its largest total square footage of office buildings makes it become the city with the greatest energy saving opportunity in China. Our analysis shows that the aggregated energy savings potential of office buildings at 35 major Chinese cities is 112 GWh in 2015, even after allowing for a 43 GWh loss due to China's serious air pollution issue especially in North China. 8-78% of the cooling energy consumption can be potentially reduced by natural ventilation depending on local weather and air quality.

45,WOS:000418978100123,"Under the Paris Agreement, nations and cities are under increasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Brownfield land redevelopment promises climate change mitigation benefits; however, no studies have attempted to quantify the mitigation potential on a city level. Here we propose a method for this purpose. The method is based on life cycle assessment of GHG emission as compared to greenfield land development, in three categories: (1) primary impact (associated with physical state of brownfield sites and greenfield sites), (2) secondary impact (associated with remediation activities at brownfield sites), and (3) tertiary impact (associated with post-remediation usage of the brownfield sites and avoided usage of greenfield land). A quantitative assessment was conducted for the city of San Francisco in the US, a growing city with ambitious carbon reduction plans. City wide contaminated land remediation activities were found to render a significant secondary impact, resulting in increased GHG emission of 3.54 Mt CO2 eq. However, by averting the development of greenfield land, this negative impact was partially off-set by a primary impact reduction of 1.22 Mt CO2 eq. Moreover, the redevelopment of brownfield land offers large tertiary impact reductions due to higher housing density, less utility and road construction needs, shorter commute distances, and smaller household energy consumption. Overall, the results show that brownfield land redevelopment led to a net GHG reduction of 51.9 Mt CO2 eq. over a 70-year period, or 0.74 Mt CO2 yr(-1), the equivalent of 14% of San Francisco's 5.3 Mt CO2 eq. GHG emission in 2010. It was found that reduced household electricity and space heating energy consumption and shorter commute distances were the main contributors, accounting for 41.2% and 34.0% of the tertiary impact reduction, respectively. While it is not expected that all cities can fully capture these climate change mitigation benefits, the present study demonstrates a quantification method and emphasizes the large climate change mitigation potential associated with brownfield land redevelopment. Progression of this premise will require regulators and policy makers to better align cities' climate change mitigation strategies with urban planning and development actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The impacts of intraseasonal climate variations on ozone levels in Tucson, Arizona from April through September of 1995 to 1998 are determined by relating variations in ozone levels to variations in atmospheric conditions and emissions of ozone's precursor chemicals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and by determining month-specific atmospheric conditions that are conducive to elevated ozone levels. Results show that the transport of ozone and its precursor chemicals within the Tucson area causes the highest ozone levels to be measured at a down-wind monitor. The highest ozone levels occur in August, due in part to the presence of the North American monsoon. Atmospheric conditions conducive to elevated ozone concentrations differ substantially between the and foresummer (May and June) and the core monsoon months (July and August). Transport of pollution from Phoenix may have a substantial impact on elevated ozone concentrations during April, May, and June, while El Paso/Ciudad Juarez-derived pollution may contribute significantly to elevated ozone concentrations in August and September. Two broad policy implications derive from this work, Regional pollutant transport, both within die U.S. and between the U.S. and Mexico, is a potential issue that needs to be examined more intensively in future studies.

54,WOS:000266229600008,"Issues related to sustainable urbanisation are best addressed when coordinated within a strategic framework and facilitated by a system of policy formulation that combines local opinions with scientific insights. This implies that planning for sustainable urbanisation has the potential to minimise climate change threats. While there is a pressing need for this potential to be realised globally, the current level of success in fast growing cities of the developing world is very limited. An approach to overcome this limitation has recently been successful in Dhaka, one of the fastest growing global megacities. It involved the identification of a strategic framework for the city. This framework was then combined with a locally-informed model of sustainable urbanisation to produce the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Planning Support System (DMDPSS). This paper discusses the climate change adaptation and mitigation issues that can be addressed through such a method in Dhaka, using a scenario-based approach. Two alternative development options (constrained and unconstrained) are constructed and analysed. A common set of indicators are used: first to evaluate which alternative is more sustainable: and then the mitigation and adaptation issues addressed. Results show that the 'constrained' scenario, which includes a series of development limitations, is both more sustainable and can address more mitigation and adaptation issues than the other alternative. The scenario analysis, however, is only a part of the strategic framework needed for Dhaka. Indeed other factors, such as dissemination of facts and issues, and the ease and equity of communication in the community, are critical both for progress towards sustainability and to enhance community resilience to climate change. The paper concludes that the optimum combination of adaptation and mitigation measures can be identified in fast growing cities by using systems, such as the DMDPSS, based on the core principles of sustainable development.

The per cubic meter cost of harvesting rainwater was compared to that of producing desalinated water. It was found that harvested rainwater is cheaper to capture than desalinated water produced from renewable energy-driven desalination plants, but that is not the case for fossil fuel-powered desalination. The study also considered the effects of rainwater harvesting on mitigating floods and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The city is the hub of modern human life and the urban transport sector is developing fast. Specifically, in the Internet era, the development of public transport has brought new challenges and opportunities to urban passenger transport. Thus, research on the energy demand and environmental emissions of the urban transport sector is significant and timely. This paper takes Beijing's public transport as an example and applies the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model to analyze the energy demand and the main greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under different scenarios during the period 2016-2030. The results show that: 1) if the government fails to guide the development of passenger transport appropriately, its energy demand and GHG emissions will rise rapidly and under the baseline scenario, the energy demand and emissions in 2030 are about 1.8 times those oft 2015; 2) the scenarios of developing public transport and transport sharing have a significant effect of energy saving and emission reduction and in 2030 the energy demand and GHG emissions falls by 25%-30% compared with that of the baseline scenario, so the combination of public transport and transport sharing is a wise choice for the low carbon development of the passenger transport sector in Beijing; 3) scenarios of easing road congestion and new-energy and clean-energy vehicle development have huge potential for energy saving and emission reduction, particularly the internal adjustment of the energy structure in the scenario of developing new-energy and clean-energy vehicles, which can greatly reduce the demand for traditional energy sources and reduce GHG emissions. This paper illustrates the development trends of energy demand and GHG emissions in Beijing's passenger transport sector under the scenarios of transport sharing development and traditional development in the Internet era, providing a basis for decision making.

Official government standards are used as criteria for measuring the performance of the urban form types. Criteria derived from government documents emphasise the efficiency and low-carbon emission of the transportation system and efficiency in land use, via higher densities. Minimum site areas devoted to green space are also specified. We compared the use of land resources in a sample of 9 hutong areas with those of a sample of 22 newly built communities. We collected traffic data and interviewed residents in these areas. We also examined transportation as a user of urban land, as well as the implications for land resources if the 2002 conservation plan is fully implemented. It was found that the hutong development models underperform with regard to building density depending on form type, but achieve much higher population densities than suburban housing. Motor traffic infrastructure in contemporary development takes up 3 times as much of the development area as the hutong do in their development area. The hutong outperform the rest of the urban fabric with regard to sustainable transport with 0.17 of the car mode proportion for all of Beijing.

Using the two-level parking model, the optimal structure of parking rates for inside/outside business zones and during peak/off-peak hours was calculated. In addition, the relationship between the government (which represents the public benefit) and car users, as well as the relationships among car users in the parking system were investigated. The results indicate that equilibrium among all of the agents in the parking system can be obtained using the proposed parking rate structure. The findings provide a better understanding of parking behavior, and the two-level parking model presented in the paper can be used to determine the optimal parking rate to balance the temporal and spatial distribution of parking demand in urban areas.

62,WOS:000373907500006,"Many different approaches are needed to achieve reductions in GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Carbon emissions trading schemes (ETSs) are widely used in industry and are effective in reducing the overall social cost of emissions abatement. This article reports the development of a downstream ETS for the transportation sector and its application in Shenzhen, China. The ETS was devised as a mandatory cap-and-trade scheme and, as a first step, was applied to public transportation. An integrated cap was set on the total emissions from buses and taxis: an absolute cap for existing vehicles and a relative increment for new entrants. Allowances were allocated by grandfathering or benchmarking and a 'reverse mechanism' was established to encourage the transformation of urban transportation to a low-carbon system. Online fuel consumption monitoring was used to quantify the emissions from vehicles, and the operators were required to surrender enough allowances or credits to account for their verified annual emissions. The mechanisms for allowance trading and carbon offsets provided sufficient flexibility to make emissions abatement and the use of new-energy vehicles and environmentally friendly travel within Shenzhen's urban transportation system economically attractive. Policy relevance The transportation sector is becoming a major contributor to the growth in China's GHG emissions. Achieving large reductions in GHG emissions from the transportation sector is a great challenge and requires both technology and policy innovation. The tradable carbon permit is a popular concept in mitigating climate change, but the introduction of a cap-and-trade ETS into the transportation sector is a relatively innovative concept. Shenzhen has launched the first cap-and-trade ETS in a developing country and is currently exploring ways to mitigate carbon emissions by a downstream cap-and-trade ETS for the transportation sector. This article considers the main institutional arrangements and regulatory framework of Shenzhen's transportation carbon ETS. It not only refreshes the theoretical analysis and practical application of downstream cap-and-trade carbon emissions trading in urban transportation, but also provides developing countries with a cost-effective instrument to mitigate their rapid growth in traffic carbon emissions during urbanization.","Jiang, JJ, Ye, B, Ma, XM, Miao, LX",4,Shenzhen,CHN,10.1080/14693062.2014.1003526,SRID=4326;POINT (114.0683 22.54554),10358381,"Controlling GHG emissions from the transportation sector through an ETS: institutional arrangements in Shenzhen, China",2016

Why do CO2 emissions per capita vary across twenty-two major Asian cities? To what extent are relevant environmental indicators associated with CO2 emissions? To answer these questions, we begin by reviewing the climate co-benefits of existing environmental indicators (waste, green space, water, public transport and energy use) and climate change. Based on a literature review, we hypothesize that cities with higher resource use and wealth will have higher CO2 per capita emissions. To test the hypotheses, we analyze the relationship between tentative co-benefits of existing environmental indicators and CO2 emissions per capita using regression analysis. We find that a city's energy inefficiency, waste generation per capita, and GDP per capita are positively associated with CO2 emissions per capita, while we control for a battery of variables such as population and industrial structure.

Firstly, the statistical analysis of weather data was carried out to identify the prevailing wind direction during a typical winter heating season in the location. It was to ensure the windbreak planted rightly to maximise its sheltering benefits for the buildings in its leeward. This analysis, which revealed the main weather features in the location, would help to better comprehend the results of the thermal modelling and gain insight of how the load responses to the climate.

Changes in solid waste composition and disposal methods, along with urbanisation, can certainly affect greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste.

According to Beijing's 12th Five-Year Plan, the local government will continue to both promote the service sector and seek reductions in carbon emissions. We developed an input-output subsystem assessment to study carbon emissions associated with the service sector. Based on the subsystem of service productive activity, the analysis decomposes carbon emissions into 5 components (demand volume component, own component, feedback component, spillover component, and intra-sector spillover component) to construct a detailed direct and indirect emissions path. We found that the transportation, storage, mail and telecommunications subsector accounts for a high level of direct emissions, as shown by the demand volume component and the own component. In this subsector, financial support and policies focus on the promotion of new-energy vehicles (e.g. electric vehicles) and renewable energy for transportation (e.g. fuel ethanol) to reduce emissions. Furthermore, the scientific studies and technical services subsector, the hotels and restaurants subsector, and the health care, social security and social welfare subsector contribute greatly to indirect emissions. However, these service activities are widely seen as low-carbon emitters and are neglected by regulations aimed at reducing emissions. With respect to these subsectors, financial support should be provided and guidelines established to improve energy efficiency and prevent carbon emissions from spilling over from the service to the non-service sector.","Ge, JP, Lei, YL",7,Beijing,CHN,10.3354/cr01224,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,"Carbon emissions from the service sector: an input-output application to Beijing, China",2014

In order to calculate the energy consumption for cooling and heating and assess the whole energy efficiency of envelop designs, a new evaluation index on energy and thermal performance for office building envelop (EETPO) is put forward. Three cities of Shenyang, Wuhan and Guangzhou in China are selected for EETPO analysis, which represent the cold zone, hot summer cold winter zone and hot summer warm winter zone, respectively. The regression equations between EETPO and energy use for cooling/heating are studied in three cities, illustrations indicate that the regression lines fit extremely well and the algorithm is accurate and simple. According to the compulsory indices stipulated by standard (GB50189-2005), the maximum allowable values of EETPO are determined in three cities, the maximum EETPOc in cooling period is 1.750 W/m(3) K in Wuhan and 1.733 W/m(3) K in Guangzhou, the maximum EETPOh in heating period is 0.200 W/m(3) K in Shenyang and 0.414 W/m(3) K in Wuhan.

Effective mitigation action requires comprehension of the scale of the problem. Data limitations, however, have thus far constrained efforts to understand how changes in demographics, travel behavior, and policy might affect future emissions of greenhouse gases. This study uses recently available data on city-level travel patterns to forecast emissions from passenger transport for three metropolitan areas in India: Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Surat. The forecasts compare carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for three scenarios by using various mode choice and trip length assumptions. The results predict dramatic increases in emissions under all circumstances. Travel in Surat is forecast to generate between 1.9 and 9.5 million tons of CO2; in Mumbai, travel could generate 10.3 to 49 million tons.

At the same time, it can also help to reduce the extreme heatwave risks in non-air-conditioned buildings. This study investigates the potential applications of PCMs to be integrated into buildings to reduce heat stress risks during extreme heatwave periods through numerical simulations. This study uses 2009 weather data of Melbourne, a city that regularly experiences heatwaves in summer. A detached single-storey house, without an active air-conditioning system, is refurbished with the installation of macro-encapsulated Bio-PCM (TM) mats as inner linings of walls and ceilings. Dynamic thermal simulations have been undertaken to reveal the performance of, and factors that influence, the adoption of PCM to reduce heat stress during heatwave periods. Discomfort index has been used as an indicator for measuring the indoor heat stress risks. The results showed that PCM refurbishment can effectively reduce the indoor heat stress risks, indicating a significant advantage in improving the occupant health and comfort. The selection of suitable phase transition temperature, and amount of PCM, is critical for this application to be effective. Appropriate selection of PCM with better ventilation design could reduce the severe discomfort period by 65% during extreme heatwave conditions. While the thermal energy storage of PCM reduces the indoor heat stress, night ventilation enhances the cool storage of PCM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is still unclear which aspects a low-carbon city (LCC) covers and how to quantify and certify its low carbon level. In this paper, an indicator framework for the evaluation of LCC was established from the perspectives of Economic, Energy pattern, Social and Living, Carbon and Environment, Urban mobility, Solid waste, and Water. A comprehensive evaluation method was employed for LCC ranking by using the entropy weighting factor method. The benchmark values for LCC certification were also identified. The framework was applied to 10 global cities to rank their low-carbon levels. The comparison of cities at different levels of economic, social, and environmental development enhances the holistic of the study. The results showed that Stockholm, Vancouver, and Sydney ranked higher than the benchmark value, indicating these cities achieved a high level of low-carbon development. Sao Paulo, London, and Mexico City are still in the slow transition towards LCC. Beijing and New York each has much lower LCC level than the benchmark value due to the poor environmental performance and infrastructure supports caused by intensive human activities. The proposed indicator system serves as a guideline for the standardization of LCC and further identifies the key aspects of low-carbon management for different cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Current system-scale restoration efforts aim to restore natural hydrologic regimes to reestablish pre-drainage ecosystem functioning through increased water availability, quality and timing. Aquatic transport of carbon in this ecosystem, primarily as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), plays a critical role in biogeochemical cycling and food-web dynamics, and will be affected both by water management policies and climate change. To better understand DOC dynamics in South Florida estuaries and how hydrology, climate and water management may affect them, 14 years of monthly data collected in the Shark River estuary were used to examine DOC flux dynamics in a broader environmental context. Multivariate statistical methods were applied to long-term datasets for hydrology, water quality and climate to untangle the interconnected environmental drivers that control DOC export at monthly and annual scales. DOC fluxes were determined to be primarily controlled by hydrology but also by seasonality and long-term climate patterns and episodic weather events. A four-component model (salinity, rainfall, inflow, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) capable of predicting DOC fluxes (R-2 = 0.84, p < 0.0001, n = 155) was established and applied to potential climate change scenarios for the Everglades to assess DOC flux response to climate and restoration variables.

This study conducted a survey of the MC technologies and activities in Hanoi using questionnaires. GPS monitoring, and video camera in 2008. The data were collected for three typical road types (highways, arterials, residential streets) in 3 zones of the city. Majority of MC in Hanoi were relatively new (3.6 years), had 4-stroke engine, but only 6% was equipped with catalyst exhaust control devices. About 35% of the fleet did not comply with any EURO standards. The MC daily driving was 20 km, mostly done on arterial streets. The main driving features in Hanoi arterials and residential streets were of low speeds with frequent starts/stops and idling. International Vehicle Emissions (WE) model produced adjusted emission factors (EFs) that were compared with the limited available measurement data. The fleet emission was estimated for 2008 as a base case and for two ""what-if"" faster technology implementation scenarios: scenario 1 assumed that the entire fleet in 2008 conformed at least EURO2 and scenario 2 assumed 100% MC met the EURO3 standard. Total emissions from the fleet in 2008 of CO, VOC, NOx, SO2, PM10, and CH4 were 158, 51.5, 9.5, 0.17, 2.4 and 9.5 kt, respectively.

To reduce air pollution, many megacities have relocated energy supplies and polluted industries to their outer regions. However, regional transport then becomes an important source of air pollution in megacities. To improve air quality before and during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a wide range of control strategies were implemented, including the relocation of polluting industries. High sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations were occasionally observed during this period. Potential sources from southern regions of Beijing were indicated by backward trajectories model and urban/rural stationary measurements, but direct evidence was lacking. Here we used a mobile laboratory to characterize the spatial distribution and regional transport of SO2 to Beijing during the Campaign for Air Quality Research in Beijing and the Surrounding Region (CAREBEIJING)-2008. Among the five days chosen for the case studies during the Olympic air pollution control period, four had high SO2 concentrations (6, 20 August and 3, 4 September 2008) while one had low SO2 concentration (11 September 2008). The average values of SO2 during the low SO2 concentration day were 3.9 ppb, much lower than during the high concentration days (7.8 ppb). This result implied an impact by regional transport from outside Beijing. During these days, we captured transport events of SO2 from areas south of Beijing, with a clear decrease in SO2 concentrations southeast of the 6th to 4th Ring Roads around Beijing and along the 140 km highway from Tianjin to Beijing. The influx of SO2 through the 4th to 6th Ring Roads ranged from 2.1 to 4.6 kg s(-1) on 4 September and 0.2 to 1.6 kg s(-1) on 20 August 2008. The differences of influx in days were due to the variations of emission changes, transport directions and dilutions. Locally emitted SO2 from a source located along Jingshi Highway outside the southwest section of the 5th Ring Road of Beijing was identified using wind field data generated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the measured particle size distribution, with an estimated flux of 0.1 kg s(-1) to Beijing.

Thus far it has proven to be difficult to provide meaningful recommendations on how to deal with these barriers. In this paper we propose a different perspective, with different epistemological assumptions about cause and effect than most existing barrier studies, to analyze why adaptation is often challenging. Using the mechanismic framework, we study how the idea for an innovative ""Water Plaza"" was realized in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Mechanisms are understood as patterns of interaction between actors that bring about change in the governance process that lead to policy impasses. Our analysis reveals three mechanisms that explain the impasses in the first Water Plaza pilot project: the risk-innovation mechanism, the frame polarization mechanism, and the conflict infection mechanism. Only after several substantive changes in the project design, location choice, and process architecture was the project of Water Plaza's revitalized. We discuss how the short-sighted ideas about cause-effect relationships, reflected in the superficial identification of barriers, may prove to be counterproductive; if there is high uncertainty about the risks of an innovation, the solution of offering more certainty is not very helpful and could, as it happened in the case study, trigger other mechanisms, creating an even tighter deadlock. Our study also suggests that when adaptation is considered as something innovative, the chances will increase that the risk-innovation mechanism will occur. We conclude that unearthing mechanisms offers new opportunities and different types of strategic interventions in practice than most existing studies have offered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we characterize the radiative benefits, i.e. the additional shortwave radiation leaving the atmosphere, from the installation of highly reflective 'cool' roofs in urban areas in India that face relatively large local aerosol burdens. We use a previously tested column radiative transfer model to estimate the energy per unit area reflected to space from increasing the surface albedo at six cities within India. The model is used to characterize radiative transfer each day over five years (2008-2012) based on mid-day satellite retrievals of MODIS aerosol depth, cloud water path, and average surface albedo and MERRA atmospheric profiles of temperature and composition. Compared against ten months of field observations in two cities, the model derived incoming surface shortwave radiation estimates relative to observations show small biases (0.5% and -2.6%, at Pantnagar and Nainital, respectively). Despite the high levels of local aerosols we found cool roofs provided significant radiative benefits at all locations. Averaged over the five year period we found that increasing the albedo of 1 m(2) of roof area by 0.5 would reflect to space 0.9-1.2 kWh daily from 08:30-15:30 LST, depending on location. This is equivalent to a constant forcing of 37-50Wm(-2) (equivalent to reducing CO2 emissions by 74 to 101 kg CO2 m(-2) roof area).

88,WOS:000172356200007,"The international literature has paid much attention to so-called 'fringe benefits' of greenhouse gas (GHG) policies. The concept is that GHG emission reduction in developing countries will also reduce local air pollution. On the basis of this concept, it is argued that it is possible to achieve simultaneously a reduction of local air pollution and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In reality, however, there is a sequence to the policy agenda. First the apparent local air pollution problems are tackled then the more distant greenhouse gas problem is considered. This sequence has consequences for the optimal policy selection. Moreover, most studies that focus on fringe benefits of GHG policies neglect the existence of cost-effective dedicated abatement technology for local air pollutants. This paper analyses the optimal set of policies for reduction of SO2, NOx and CO2 in Shanghai for the period of 2000-2020. The analysis is based on a linear programming MARKAL model for the Shanghai energy system. The results show that the relevance of no-regret options is limited because Shanghai has improved its energy efficiency significantly in recent years. The model calculations suggest that this trend will persist if current policies are sustained. This energy efficiency improvement and the planned introduction of natural gas have important benefits from a GHG emission point of view. These benefits have received little attention as yet. Local air pollution reduction can result in additional GHG emission reduction up to 2010. After 2010, however, its CO2 emission co-benefits are limited. Dedicated abatement technology is the most cost-effective way to reduce local air pollution. An additional incentive of 100 Yuan/t CO2 emission reduction (12.5 Euro/t) results in an additional emission reduction of 11% (22 Mt CO2), and it results in a significantly different technology mix than stand-alone local air pollution policies. The total potential for GHG emission reduction amounts to 66 Mt in 2010 and to 49 Mt in 2020 compared to base case levels without policies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

89,WOS:000346358200005,"Urban stormwater runoff management systems are usually designed to meet performance standards based on historical climate data, which are assumed to be stationary. Based on the evidence from climate change impact studies, in the near future, stormwater management systems, within the built environment, may need to meet performance expectations under climatic conditions different from historical climate. Considering the impacts of climate change on rainfall intensities and stormwater runoff peak flow and volumes, and in turn the effectiveness of mitigation, practices for urban stormwater management are desirable. This paper presents the results of a climate change impact study on urban stormwater runoff in the Bronx River watershed, New York City. Considering the impacts of climate change on watershed runoff, the potential for low-impact development (LID) controls to mitigate the impacts was investigated. Stormwater runoff and LID controls were modeled using the U.S. EPA Storm Water Management Model version 5 (EPA SWMM5). The simulations were driven by historical precipitation modified to represent future projections using a change factor methodology based on precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Using the change factor method, historical precipitation was perturbed to obtain future data, based on three climate scenarios projecting maximum, mean, and minimum values for rainfall. Results of frequency analysis performed on the simulated peak flow rates, with different recurrence intervals, showed a noticeable increase in the frequency of occurrence of extreme storm events and their peak values, under future extreme climate conditions. An LID control scenario consisting of rainwater harvesting, porous pavement, and bioretention was designed and evaluated using the SWMM model. The results showed that, while average increase in historical annual runoff volume under climate change impacts was approximately 48%, the LID controls could provide an average reduction of 41% in annual runoff volume. Application of the LID controls also reduced peak flow rates by an average of 8 to 13%. LID implementation decreased watershed runoff corresponding to 2-year and 50-year return periods, by 28 and 14%, respectively. In conclusion, retrofits with LID controls may provide not only their inherent benefits (e.g., runoff volume and water quality), but also additional climate impact mitigation benefits for stormwater runoff.

The aim is to study the CEEP and CO2 emission reductions for this city that is included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO. The total CEEP is found to be 31% (20.6 GWh) resulting in a CO2 reduction of 57% (33.3 kton). The categorization method showed that the buildings could be divided in four clusters depending on building material, geometry and layout. The LCC analysis revealed that the energy efficiency measure packages were cluster specific. It is shown that multi-story wood buildings (Cluster II) have lowest specific LCC, and would arguably be the starting point for a renovation process. Presently most of the studied buildings are connected to the district heating (DH). The results show that heat pump (HP) and wood boiler (WB) is cost-optimal heating system for multi-story stone and wood buildings, respectively. In order for the DH to compete with HP and WB, the DH price needs to be reduced by 23% and 16%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While direct emissions from infrastructure use are well-known, information about indirect emissions from their construction is highly fragmented. Here, we estimated the carbon footprint of the existing global infrastructure stock in 2008, assuming current technologies, to be 122 (-20/+15) Gt CO2. The average per-capita carbon footprint of infrastructures in industrialized countries (53 (+/- 6) t CO2) was approximately 5 times larger that that of developing countries (10 (+/- 1) t CO2). A globalization of Western infrastructure stocks using current technologies would cause approximately 350 Gt CO2 from materials production, which corresponds to about 35-60% of the remaining carbon budget available until 2050 if the average temperature increase is to be limited to 2 degrees C, and could thus compromise the 2 degrees C target. A promising but poorly explored mitigation option is to build new settlements using less emissions-intensive materials, for example by urban design; however, this strategy is constrained by a lack of bottom-up data on material stocks in infrastructures.

92,WOS:000325461500013,"This article assesses the sustainability benefits of replacing virgin sand and crushed limestone with Red Sand for road construction and top dressing. The sustainability of Red Sand was assessed using a triple bottom line analysis that includes economic, social, and environmental objectives. Each of these objectives consists of a number of headline performance indicators, with each being the aggregate of key performance indicators that measure whether Red Sand applications foster or impede sustainability. Red Sand is a newly developed product that is expected to be commercially available in 2014. It is produced by washing and carbonating the coarse fraction of the residue produced by the Bayer alumina refining process. Our assessment indicates that replacing virgin sand and crushed limestone with Red Sand will provide a range of financial and environmental benefits. For example, some environmental impacts associated with using virgin sand and crushed limestone, such as loss of biodiversity and land degradation, can be avoided by substituting Red Sand. Also, the use of Red Sand for road construction and top dressing is expected to conserve land and raw materials for future generations, thus enhancing intergenerational social equity. The energy consumption associated with producing Red Sand is projected to be lower than that required to quarry virgin sand and crushed limestone, thereby conserving energy and reducing the overall greenhouse impact of road construction and top-dressing applications that use virgin sand and crushed limestone. The greenhouse benefit of Red Sand is further enhanced by avoiding the loss of vegetation associated with sand and limestone quarrying. There are also intangible benefits expected from the substitution of Red Sand, including ecological, aesthetic, and recreational benefits associated with bushland conservation, a significant issue in areas surrounding metropolitan Perth.","Biswas, WK, Cooling, D",4,Perth,AUS,10.1111/jiec.12030,SRID=4326;POINT (115.8614 -31.95224),1896548,Sustainability Assessment of Red Sand as a Substitute for Virgin Sand and Crushed Limestone,2013

94,WOS:000348198800001,"The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami caused devastation all along the coast of eastern Japan. Ishinomaki City was one of the most severely damaged municipalities, though the height of the tsunami in this city was smaller than that in Iwate and northern Miyagi. A large difference in the extent of building damage was found comparing two areas of Ishinomaki: one not protected by breakwaters, and the other behind the breakwaters of a large Fishery port. In this paper, the authors perform numerical simulations to determine whether these general breakwaters, which were designed not to block tsunamis but wind waves, reduced the tsunami's energy and contributed to a reduction in inundation of the areas behind the port. Before assessing the effectiveness of breakwaters against tsunamis, simulated inundation heights in each of these two areas were compared with heights measured by The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Joint Survey Group. It was found that a simulation with larger Manning's n value (n = 0.30) can evaluate inundation more precisely than when this value is small (n = 0.06), as often used by Japanese coastal engineers. Comparing the region protected by breakwaters with the unsheltered area, the results of a 2D shallow water equation model do not show a significant difference in inundation mainly because the tsunami intrudes through the openings in the breakwater and fills up the port basin with seawater in a very short time. Therefore, the effectiveness of general breakwaters in reducing tsunami impact should not be overestimated. However, a hypothetical study shows that water levels could be greatly reduced if the port were fully enclosed by breakwaters. This implies that a port could substantially reduce tsunami inundation if the breakwater openings were equipped to be closed before tsunami arrival. The authors also demonstrate that the difference in the extent of building damage in the two areas of Ishinomaki considered can be explained by the difference in drag forces due to the topography as well as the difference in land use, rather than by the presence of breakwaters.",,7,Ishinomaki,JPN,10.1142/S0578563414500181,SRID=4326;POINT (141.3 38.41667),117233,ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GENERAL BREAKWATERS IN REDUCING TSUNAMI INUNDATION IN ISHINOMAKI,2014

In this paper the UK example of Newcastle-upon-Tyne is used to critique current practice, noting that important features of urban energy systems are often omitted by bottom-up tools including interactions between technologies, spatial disaggregation of demand, and the ability to pursue over-arching policy goals like cost minimization. An alternative optimization-based approach is then described and applied to the Newcastle case, at the scale of both the whole city and the South Heaton district, and using Monte Carlo techniques to address policy uncertainty. The results show that this new method can help policy makers draw more robust policy conclusions, sensitive to spatial variations in energy demand and capturing the interactions between developments in the national energy system and local policy options.

97,WOS:000405876100007,"While the urban is identified as a productive site for addressing climate change, the post-political' critique dismisses climate policy as a vacuous discourse that obscures power relations and exclusion, defends the established neoliberal order, and silences challenges. This paper argues that rather than consensus, there is a conflict between urban climate policy and the need to reignite economic growth in the context of austerity urbanism, but also that we should not assume that challenges to neoliberal understandings of the sensible' will always be disregarded. Rather, urban climate policy can be progressed through partnership processes utilising co-production' techniques which entail significant agonistic, if not antagonistic, contestation. The argument is illustrated with a case study of climate policy making in the context of austerity urbanism in Liverpool, UK. While low carbon' is conceptualised by elite actors in Liverpool in neoliberal terms as a source of new low carbon jobs and businesses, with an emphasis on energy security and fuel poverty, this view is not unchallenged. The paper recounts how an ad hoc group of actors in the city came together to form a partnership advocating for more strategic decarbonisation, which should be progressed through a bid for the city to be European Green Capital. The disputes that emerged around this agenda suggest that in the context of austerity urbanism the need for cities to act to mitigate against dangerous climate change is not as uncontested as conceptions of the post-political suggest.","North, P, Nurse, A, Barker, T",5,Liverpool,GBR,10.1177/0308518X16686353,SRID=4326;POINT (-2.97794 53.41058),468945,The neoliberalisation of climate?

We also compute estimates for 2002 and 2011 and compare to our 2014 emission estimates. Across all locations analyzed, average total emissions increased by 3% and average per capita emissions decreased by 14%. Where possible, we also compare our emission estimates to those reported by the cities in their climate action plans and find an average absolute difference between our estimates and those reported by the cities of 5.6 metric tons CO2 per person, likely due to temporal and scope differences between the two estimates. Our integrated emission estimation approach complements bottom-up approaches typically employed by municipalities and helps practitioners divert their attention and resources away from continuous emission accounting toward more impactful emission mitigation efforts.","Markolf, SA, Matthews, HS, Azevedo, IL, Hendrickson, C",3,Houston; Tucson; Baton Rouge; Lancaster,USA; USA; USA; USA,10.1088/1748-9326/aa5731,SRID=4326;POINT (-95.36327 29.76328); SRID=4326;POINT (-110.92648 32.22174); SRID=4326;POINT (-91.15455 30.45075); SRID=4326;POINT (-118.13674 34.69804),2296224; 531641; 228590; 161103,An integrated approach for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from 100 US metropolitan areas,2017

In particular, regulatory bodies in Australia are demanding that water managers exhaust network management efficiencies before considering new water source options (e.g., dams, desalination, pipelines, etc.). Demand management incentive schemes in conjunction with water recycling and pressure and leakage management (PLM) initiatives are a few examples of least-cost planning strategies being adopted by water authorities to achieve water balance without expanding the water infrastructure asset requirements. Potential benefits of PLM strategies have been predicted by these authorities worldwide in areas such as deferred capital works, reduced corrective maintenance, reduced treatment costs, energy savings, reduced reclaimed water discharges, and improvements to customer service. However, justification for PLM options remains difficult due to the limited amount of quantified evidence for most of the above-mentioned benefits over an urban water system's life cycle.

Rotterdam's sustainability office initiated a knowledge co-production process in which visions and transition pathways for the sustainable and resilient future of Rotterdam, considering existing challenges and opportunities, were co-created. These scenarios were analyzed using a straightforward scenario approach to spatially identify, map and analyze change. By mapping change, trade-offs and synergies between different land-use options among the scenarios, this study disentangles the complexity of a stakeholder co-production process and is able to discover crucial transition areas. Furthermore, multiple urban ecosystem services were valued for each scenario, and environmental impacts could be detected for all of the different visions. The mapping approach applied is a good method to communicate the consequences of induced land-use change back to stakeholders and decision-makers and thus contributes to the visual loop of real co-design. Identifying the hot-spots of change enables attention to be drawn to the most rewarding areas for transition, and moreover, it shows areas in which different visions are not conflicting but rather cross-benefiting each other. Additionally, hard-spots or areas in which existing visions contradict each other show that careful mediation and the revision of change options might be the way to go. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed plan is modelled looking specifically at Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from: materials used in the construction, not only of the buildings but also the infrastructure (i.e. roads and paving in the public realm); electricity and gas consumption through the use of everyday residential and commercial appliances and equipment; the energy required for the pumping and treatment of water supplied to the development site including water required for the irrigation of public areas as well as for individual consumption; and private motor vehicles owned by residents on the development site. A baseline model representing the proposed plan built to existing codes and standards is used to determine the impact of a range of low-carbon interventions proposed for the development, including reducing parking and adding good quality public transport. Significant GHG emissions reductions of greater than 50% are possible at quite minimal additional cost due to the alternative systems of development that are found to be effective at a precinct scale.

Even though the calculation process uses approximate values for the variables involved rather than taking their dynamic evolution into account, it is fairly precise, giving results that are comparable to other more sophisticated and less easy to handle procedures such as the worldwide known f-CHART, TRNSYS, ISOFOTON and CENSOLAR computation programs. The predictive validity of the procedure has also been tested by comparing the results with those obtained experimentally via a solar heat collector installed on the roof of a building in the city of Badajoz. We believe that the procedure together with the computation program, will be of great use to builders and architects, since it allows a solar installation to be rapidly sized for applications in active solar heating schemes for building design.

Integrating energy input-output model with carbon emission pinch analysis, we propose a framework for managing urban energy system. This framework could analyze current energy demands and CO(2) emissions, predict their future possibilities and optimize energy mix of key sectors under CO(2) emission constraints. Key sectors are identified by the energy input-output table from both direct and accumulative perspectives. Moreover, taking Suzhou, a typical manufacturing center and export-oriented city in China, as a case example, energy metabolism of Suzhou in 2020 is predicted using energy input-output model. And three sectors named Coking. Smelting and pressing of metals and Production and supply of electric power are identified to have big effects on CO(2) emissions. Subsequently, energy mix of three identified key sectors is optimized under CO(2) emission constraints by the carbon emission pinch analysis. According to the results, clean energy sources will occupy a great position in Suzhou's future energy demands. And the reuse of wastes as energy sources should be limited to achieve CO(2) mitigation targets. Finally, policy implications of results and future work are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We modelled interventions that would contribute to the achievement of these targets by reducing the permeability of the dwellings to 3 m(3) m(-2) h(-1) at 50 Pa, combined with the introduction of mechanical ventilation and heat recovery (MVHR) systems. It is assumed that the current mean outdoor PM2.5 concentration of 13 mu g m(-3) decreased to 9 mu g m(-3) by 2050 due to emission control policies. Our primary finding was that installation of (assumed perfectly functioning) MVHR systems with permeability reduction are associated with appreciable reductions in PM2.5 exposure in both smoking and non-smoking dwellings. Modelling of the future scenario for non-smoking dwellings show a reduction in annual average indoor exposure to PM2.5 of 18.8 mu g m(-3) (from 28.4 to 9.6 mu g m(-3)) for a typical household member. Also of interest is that a larger reduction of 42.6 mu g m(-3) (from 60.5 to 17.9 mu g m(-3)) was shown for members exposed primarily to cooking-related particle emisions in the kitchen (cooks). Reductions in envelope permeability without mechanical ventilation produced increases in indoor PM2.5 concentrations; 5.4 mu g m(-3) for typical household members and 9.8 mu g m(-3) for cooks. These estimates of changes in PM2.5 exposure are sensitive to assumptions about occupant behaviour, ventilation system usage and the distributions of input variables (+/- 72% for non-smoking and +/- 107% in smoking residences).

National rules and regional guidelines for treated water are regulatory instruments for the construction approval of WWTPs in Palestine. Three urban WWTPs of various technologies were selected as case studies for the assessment. The technologies applied were conventional activated sludge with anaerobic sludge digestion, extended aeration and membrane bioreactor (MBR) serving Nablus, Al-Bireh and Altira cities, respectively. Analysis of collected data on the BOD(5)removal were 96%, 98% and 99%. The removal efficiency of nitrogen reached 85% and 95% for Al-Bireh and Altira and not accounted for in Nablus WWTP. The energy required for both liquid and sludge lines was calculated based on the available data and correlated with the treatment efficacy. Results analysis revealed wide variations in the energy consumption among the three WWTPs. Altira MBR showed normal trends compared to published literature with 2.88 kWh/m(3), of which 40% was consumed by the biological treatment stage. Al-Bireh WWTP consumed 1.86 kWh/m(3) with 35% of the electrical consumption for biological stage, and 24% for the sludge line. Nablus-WWTP consumed 2.25 kWh/m(3) with 62% of the energy consumed by the biological stage and 34% for sludge line. Under load operation below the design capacities, the specific energy consumption for Al-Bireh and Nablus WWTPs are contradicting common published data for activated sludge treatment systems. Use of renewable energy could assist in the reduction of the annual energy operational costs. Assessment of solar photovoltaic (PV) application could yield electricity sufficient for Altira and Al-Bireh pump station facilities covering 9%, 15%, and 1% of their energy demand.

These neighborhoods fall into four different types: superblock, enclave, grid and traditional. The household CO2 emission includes sources of both inhome energy use and passenger transportation. The average CO2 emission per household is 7.66 t center dot a-1, including 6.87 t in-home operational emission and 792 kg transportation emission. The household CO2 emission by neighborhood categories is 10.97, 5.65, 6.49, 5.40 t center dot household(-1)center dot a(-1) for superblock, enclave, grid and traditional respectively. Superblock has the highest average emission and also the highest percent (more than 25%) of transportation emission among four different types of neighborhoods. The residential CO2 emission of superblock neighborhoods in Jinan has already reached the level in developed countries nearly ten years ago. It is predictable that more superblock neighborhoods would be built in China with the fast urbanization. How to avoid the rapid household CO2 emission growth in the future would be a systematic issue. The study also found that in addition to income and apartment area, household density, land use mix and accessibility to public transportation are three primary factors which have significant impacts on CO2 emission.

Measurements of hydrology, nutrients, and aboveground net primary productivity were made from September 1998 through March 2002. Accretion measurements were made in October 2000 and October 2004. The major hydrologic inputs to the system were the effluent, precipitation, and back water flooding from Lake Pontchartrain. Nutrient levels were generally low except in the immediate vicinity of the outfall. Mean net primary production of the freshwater forest system was significantly higher downstream of the effluent discharge (1202 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to the control site (799 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Downstream of the outfall, accretion rates were double the rate of relative sea level rise in the area. Removal efficiencies of N and P were as high as 75% and 95%, respectively. The relatively constant flow of secondarily treated municipal effluent buffered the downstream area from salinity intrusion during a region-wide drought.

Each system comprises 2m(2) of PVT collector area. Water draw patterns are those with a typical consumption of medium size houses in Bangkok, and the measured monthly average city water temperature of Bangkok has been used to estimate the energy output. The results show that the optimum water flow rate is 20kg/h for all types of PVT collectors and the effect of water flow can improve the cell efficiency of PV cells. Moreover, the total energy output from the PVT collectors, which had glass covers is very significantly higher than those without one.

The assessment is addressed in local level climate change adaptation policies in two selected cities. The city of Taipei represents places where local adaptation policies were directed mainly by the national government. The city of Tainan represents places where the municipal government plays a more critical role in framing these policies. This can result in different policymaking considerations. The assessment points out that the proposed actions of these policies are broader than a general understanding of adaptation. Mitigation strategies are addressed and sometimes highly recommended. Because of this, we can interpret these actions as resilience strategies covered under the use of the term adaptation. The notion of resilience does not stay on the rhetorical level alone. It is happening in shaping decisions - without using the terminology directly.

These experiments are socio-technical innovations with a high potential to contribute to a low carbon. Through the Global Intelligence Corps knowledge of these experiments is being disseminated across a variety of spatial contexts. Foreign cities are keen to replicate these examples of best practice; whilst technical experts, technology providers and governments are keen to export their expertise and technologies. However, the factors influencing the successful translation - movement, transformation and adaptation - of these experiments across spatial contexts requires deeper investigation. This paper explores the process using a mobile transitions conceptualisation. In this paper we develop a theoretical conceptualisation of the mobile transition process and test it using two low carbon experiments - Hammarby Sjostad (Stockholm) and BedZed (London). We identify the type of knowledge that is translatable (in the global form), and how this is modified both by the global and local assemblages throughout the process. The implication of our findings is that greater clarity is needed throughout the translation process if outcomes are to improve. Firstly, in order to determine the potential for an urban experiment to translate into a new spatial context the practitioner must understand the context from which it emerged and the context into which it will be translated. Secondly practitioners need to clearly define the translatable global form emerging from an experiment. It must be possible to decontextualise and re-contextualise the global form if it is to translate successfully. In some cases it may be impossible to decontextualise the global form without undermining the fundamental principles underlying the experiment. Thirdly, practitioners need to be aware of how the global form can be manipulated and re-represented by the global and local assemblages during the translation process. The global form is not fixed. Finally practitioners should be aware that new socio-technical systems (adopting the fundamental principles developed in the experiment) will emerge from the translation process. (C) 2017 The Author.

An analytical model has been developed for estimating an economically efficient installation and operation pattern for the distributed energy system. As an illustrative example, a numerical study is conducted of feasible distributed energy system for a model area in Shanghai, while considering five scenarios with different technology combinations. According to the simulation results, although enjoying reasonable environmental merits, it is hard to diffuse the distributed generation technologies, especially some renewable ones, in the model area from the economic point of view. Currently, the most feasible technology is the natural gas CHP system, which has a cost reduction ratio of only 0.7%. In addition, the sensitivity analyses illustrate that the introduction of electricity buy-back and the reduction of biogas price can promote the adoption of some renewable technologies to some extent.

This concern stems from such factors as the unrelenting growth of energy use, the end of an era of abundant and cheap energy, adverse environmental effects of economic growth, and the increasing participation of governments in decisions pertaining to energy supply and environmental protection.  Owing to the fact that a significant part of the shortfalls in environmental quality in contemporary societies derives from energy use, issues of ""trade-off"" between additional energy supplies and environmental quality frequently arise.  In the context of this intimate association between the economy, environment and energy, there has been a growing awareness that policy decisions on economic, environmental and energy-related issues need to be placed in the broader framework of conflicting political priorities.  These include:  meeting energy demands for sectoral end-uses; maximizing energy conservation; checking air pollution; reducing the annualized economic cost of utilization of energy systems; reducing import of energy from neighbouring regions; and increasing the capacity for utilization of domestic appliances and different modes of transport. Multi-objective decision models arise from the need to take into account the presence of a wide variety of conflicting objectives in ordinal ranking or priorities depending on the degree of importance one wants to assign to each objective.  The basic problem related to the existence of multiple objectives is the fact that decisions are normally interdependent, so that any decision to increase production has a corresponding impact on energy consumption, pollution emission and vice versa.  Pollutants considered for this study are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO(x)), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) which are the emissions caused by combustion or automation. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of energy and pollution problems interconnected with the economic structure, by using a multi-objective sectoral end-use model for addressing regional energy policy issues.  The multi-objective model proposed for the study is a ""linear goal programming (LGP)"" technique of analysing a ""reference energy system (RES)"" in a framework within which alternative policies and technical strategies may be evaluated.  The model so developed has further been tested for the city of Delhi (India) for the period 1985-86, and a scenario analysis has been carried out by assuming different policy options.",,15,Delhi,IND,10.1016/0378-7788(91)90022-U,SRID=4326;POINT (77.23148999999999 28.65195),10927986,A LINEAR GOAL PROGRAMMING-MODEL FOR URBAN ENERGY ECONOMY ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION,1991
124,WOS:000384200100003,"This research presents a method to determine the maximum potential for the capturing of solar radiation on the rooftop of buildings in an urban environment. This involves the modeling of solar energy potential and comparison to historical building energy demand profiles through the use of 3-D solar simulation software tools and geographic information systems (GIS). The objective is to accurately identify the amount of surface area that is suitable for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations and to estimate the hourly PV electricity generation potential of existing building rooftops in an urban environment. This study demonstrates a viable approach for modeling urban solar energy and offers valuable information for electricity distributors, policy makers, and urban energy planners to facilitate the substantial design of a green built environment. The developed methodology is comprised of three main sections: (1) determination of suitable rooftop area, (2) determination of the amount of incident solar radiation available per rooftop, and (3) estimation of hourly solar PV electricity generation potential. A case study was performed using this method for Ryerson University, located in Toronto, Canada. It was found that solar PV could supply up to 19% of the study area's electricity demands during peak consumption hours. The potential benefits of solar PV was also estimated based upon hourly greenhouse gas emission intensity factors as well as Time-of-Use (TOU) savings through the Ontario Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) program, which allows for better representation of the positive impacts of solar technologies.","Chow, A, Li, S, Fung, AS",1,Toronto,CAN,10.1080/15435075.2016.1170686,SRID=4326;POINT (-79.41630000000001 43.70011),2600000,"Modeling urban solar energy with high spatiotemporal resolution: A case study in Toronto, Canada",2016

In this paper, we first analyzed this policy and its effect on private passenger vehicle population. The private passenger vehicle population in Beijing from 2011 to 2020 was predicted under three different scenarios: no constraint (NC), current constraint (CC) and tighter constraint (TC). Then the assessment of vehicular emissions reduction benefits was made on the basis of private passenger vehicle population, vehicle kilometers traveled and CO2 emission factors. It was projected that the CO2 emissions in 2020 will reach 23.90, 15.55 and 13.23 million tons under NC, CC and TC respectively.

On the basis of the driving force-pressure-state-response (DPSR) model and using material flow analysis, this article proposes a framework for sustainable urban management and policy assessment. A case study city in China, Suzhou, illustrates this framework. The results show that resource consumption (excluding water), water consumption, and waste generation (excluding carbon dioxide) in Suzhou after implementation of proposed policies will be 14% lower than 2005 levels, 4.5% higher, and 28.9% higher, respectively, in 2015. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions in Suzhou will increase by 71.0% in 2015 over 2005 levels, whereas carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product) will decrease by 44.9%. Future pollution control in Suzhou should pay more attention to pollution from vehicles. In addition, goals for relative dematerialization of energy and decarbonization in Suzhou will be achieved before absolute ones are. In the short term, the urban metabolism of Suzhou in 2015 may meet corresponding urban objectives.

128,WOS:000387952900001,"Background: The use of traditional energy sources such as wood, animal dung and agricultural residue by households has been in practice since time immemorial. This has however been identified as a cause of environmental problems such as excessive deforestation and the cause of the premature death of about 4.3 million people yearly; it caused the death of about 396,000 people in Sub-Saharan Africa, where Nigeria is located, in 2002. It was also responsible for 2.7 % of the global burden of disease in that year. The reasons for fuel choice are different for different locations. This paper presents the results of a study in the factors affecting the cooking energy choice of households in Bauchi metropolis, North-east Nigeria. The aim of the study was to provide site-specific information that will aid the formulation of an effective energy policy which will result in safer and sustainable energy behaviour among households in Bauchi and Nigeria as a nation. The study therefore determined the cooking energy consumption pattern of the household and whether it follows the energy ladder model and also determined the factors that influence cooking energy choice. Methods: Two-step random sampling was used along with a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics, T test and regression analysis were used to analyse the data through the help of Microsoft excel T and SPSS. Results: The results show that biomass fuel is still being used heavily while the use of LPG has improved. Electricity and solar energy are only used by households as secondary cooking energy. The fuel use pattern is characterized by multiple fuel use, conforming more to the fuel stacking hypothesis than energy ladder hypothesis. Change in household size, dwelling ownership status, change of season, income, level of education, dwelling location, availability and affordability are the factors that were found to influence household cooking energy choice. Conclusions: This paper concludes that the heavy use of biomass for cooking in Bauchi metropolis is not environmentally healthy and requires serious attention. The major recommendation of the study is that policies encouraging the availability and use of efficient and environmentally friendly energy sources should be formulated and implemented.",,1,Bauchi,NGA,10.1186/s13705-016-0080-1,SRID=4326;POINT (9.84388 10.31032),316149,"Urban household cooking energy choice: an example of Bauchi metropolis, Nigeria",2016
129,WOS:000326847700001,"Land use planning (LUP) is central for managing issues related to climatic variation in urban environments. However, Master Plans (MPs) usually do not include climatic aspects, and few studies have addressed climate change at the urban scale, especially in developing countries. This paper proposes a framework with ten categories for assessment of climatic variation in urban LUP. Each category comprises attributes that describe a complex of relationships in influencing local temperature variations. They are analyzed for the case of the Master Plan of Porto Alegre (MPPA), the Southernmost metropolis of Brazil. It is concluded that the MPPA is strongly grounded in climate-related land and zoning coordination, but exhibits weaknesses in building, cartographical and social aspects considered synergistically relevant for tackling problems related to urban climate variation. Furthermore, the MPPA does not contain provisions related to monitoring of local climate and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and it is ineffective for improving energy efficiency. Specific MPPA failures stemming from these weaknesses include: an increase of 21.79% in the city's urbanized area from 1986 to 2011 to accommodate a similar increase in population, with significant horizontal sprawl; average temperature rise of 0.392 degrees C from 1991-2000 to 2001-2010, with statistically significant increases in temperature found since 1931; significant vehicle traffic increases, especially since 2007. From these findings, it is possible to conclude that the MPPA does not offer answers to all the imbalances related to land use, and therefore gives insufficient support to tackle the issue of rising temperatures.

Why and how was the world's first urban scheme of mandatory reduction of total emissions adopted in Tokyo and not elsewhere? What might cause diffusion of this idea in other urban areas? One key explanation behind the idea adoption is a policy evolution of trial-and-error lessons about effective policy design, desirable policy goals, and politically feasible judgments. This study finds that both agency effects and structural opportunities of policy adoption in the case of Tokyo's cap-and-trade are too specific to result in a more coherent diffusion of ideas, policies, and practices in other urban areas. Although there is a sign of diffusion of Tokyo's cap-and-trade throughout Japan, it is more likely to derive from mimicking behaviors than from learning.

This leads to an increase in indoor comfort and reduction in room air temperature that in turn results in energy saving by reducing AC demand. To assess this impact of cool roofs on buildings in rural and peri-urban areas of India, a study was performed on two un-conditioned school buildings in Hyderabad (ZPH School) and Nagpur (VNHM School). Two classrooms of same size, function, and occupancy from both the school buildings were monitored for a period of ten weeks starting from March 2014 till May 2014. The data from the experiments and their analyses showed promising results. The average reduction and peak reduction in indoor air, roof underdeck and roof overdeck surface temperatures are 2.1 degrees C, 5.0 degrees C and 12.3 degrees C and 4.3 degrees C, 10.0 degrees C and 26.3 degrees C respectively for the room with white roof as opposed to grey roof in ZPH School and 1.5 degrees C, 4.0 degrees C and 9.5 degrees C, and 3.3 degrees C, 4.2 degrees C, and 25.2 degrees C respectively in VNHM School.

The evaluations from social and private viewpoints both consider costs and benefits of refurbishments, energy consumption, and maintenance. From the social side, the externalities derived from green or cool roofing, such as aesthetic aspects, biodiversity preservation and natural habitat provision, carbon reduction, air quality improvement, and hydrological aspects, are monetized using cost-benefit transfer approaches. The first analysis result is the poor convenience of adopting a green roof compared to a cool one from the private investor's viewpoint. The second finding is the positive net present value of the social cost-benefit analysis for the green roof compared with the cool roof, due to the positive externalities of the former. Monetization of externalities allows calculating the economic incentives needed to promote the spread of green roofing in the Mediterranean area. Consequently, two different types of incentives are proposed: direct contribution for refurbishment intervention and annual reduction of local property tax. A final sensitivity analysis using the Monte Carlo method is performed on intrinsic and random variables, defined by triangular or uniform distributions.

A recent recognition that humans are part of the global ecosystem, and that human actions both cause and are affected by ecological change, brings with it an awareness of the value of nature in cities and of natural systems on which cities depend. The feedbacks between humans and their environment within an urban context can have profound implications for the growth of and change in cities, yet there is a limited understanding of the interactions between biophysical changes in cities and the implications of these changes on the quality of life for residents. The application of a coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) framework provides a timely and fruitful opportunity to enrich the theory, methods, and understanding of these feedbacks and interconnections. Here, I integrated biophysical and social dimensions relevant to managing urban stormwater by examining a case study of Portland, Oregon, USA. I used empirical data from a pre-post survey (2-yr span) of residents in eight urban neighborhoods to describe feedbacks and interactions between a localized biophysical change in the form of a large-scale decentralized stormwater program and the resulting changes in resident's perceptions in neighborhoods undergoing rapid change. My findings corroborate earlier findings suggesting that people with higher income and education levels are more likely to participate in stewardship actions. The results also suggest an overall and initial negative perception of neighborhoods facilities and services immediately following the construction of decentralized stormwater facilities, but conversely, high levels of anticipation for their construction.

It is imperative to investigate which approach is more effective in terms of GHG emission reduction in different climatic conditions. Two typical northern and southern cities in China, i.e. Tianjin in North China and Xiamen in South China are selected in this study. GHG accounting was undertaken per ton of waste received at the waste plant while GHG contributions were categorized as indirect emissions, direct emissions, substituted fossil fuel emissions and avoided emissions. The results show that North China should adopt Incineration E, while Landfill E is the better choice for South China. This study also benchmarks the waste management practices in these two cities to international practices in Europe in terms of the avoided emissions from both Incineration E and Landfill E approaches. The findings indicate that the energy recovery efficiency in Europe is higher than that of China, especially for Incineration E.

Strategies that were analyzed included infrastructure improvements, expansion of demand management policies including pricing, and accelerated penetration of electric vehicle technology. The study used a combination of travel demand model and sketch-planning methods to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strategies in reducing GHGs and their cumulative ability to achieve San Francisco's goal. The analysis results showed roadway pricing and electric vehicle strategies to have had the largest potential to reduce GHGs, although these two strategies differed significantly in cost-effectiveness. The results also showed that strategies involving share costs between public sector, private sector, and individuals had great promise in delivering reductions. Although investments in transit alone may not produce large GHG reductions, they are necessary to accommodate the mode shift of other strategies and can be paired strategically with pricing strategies. According to analysis results, San Francisco's policy goals appeared unachievable, even with ambitious assumptions about funding and policy change. These findings point to the need for policy change at a higher scale and for unprecedented changes in individual behavior to achieve GHG goals.","Brisson, EM, Sall, E, Ang-Olson, J",2,San Francisco,USA,10.3141/2287-11,SRID=4326;POINT (-122.41942 37.77493),864816,"Achieving Goals of San Francisco, California, for Greenhouse Gas Reductions in Transportation Sector What Would It Take?",2012
142,WOS:000352037300025,"The purpose of this study is to assess the applicability of an indirect evaporative passive cooling system (IEPCS) in prototypical dwelling modeled for locations across the Brazilian territory. The thermal performance of the IEPCS is analyzed, originally developed for a dwelling located in hot-humid Maracaibo, Venezuela (Vivienda Bioclimatica Prototipo - VPB-1). Diverse configuration modes were tested as part of the experimental field study, from which predictive formulas were generated and validated. The paper shows results of the expected thermal performance of the IEPCS for 411 Brazilian cities, which were obtained from the application of predictive formulas to a database consisting of TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) climate files. The efficiency of the passive cooling system was evaluated for each city with regard to its capability in reducing indoor temperatures relative to outdoors as well as Degree-Day percentages above the upper limit of the adaptive comfort zone. Detailed results for four Brazilian locations are also discussed. Results suggest that the system is capable of ensuring thermal comfort conditions for most of the cities evaluated. Average indoor temperatures reached reductions up to 2.5 degrees C below outdoor conditions; such reductions depend fundamentally on the wet bulb temperature depression. From such results, it is suggested that the IEPCS could have a great applicability in Brazil with a strong potential for improving indoor comfort conditions and, in the case of air-conditioned buildings, also promote a reduction of the energy demand on HVAC.

143,WOS:000173291500014,"Urban shade trees offer significant benefits in reducing building air-conditioning demand and improving urban air quality by reducing smog. The savings associated with these benefits vary by climate region and can be up to $200 per tree. The cost of planting trees and maintaining them can vary from $10 to $500 per tree. Tree-planting programs can be designed to have lower costs so that they offer potential savings to communities that plant trees. Our calculations suggest that urban trees play a major role in sequestering CO, and thereby delay global warming. We estimate that a tree planted in Los Angeles avoids the combustion of 18 kg of carbon annually, even though it sequesters only 4.5-11 kg (as it would if growing in a forest). In this sense, one shade tree in Los Angeles is equivalent to three to five forest trees. In a recent analysis for Baton Rouge, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City, we estimated that planting an average of four shade trees per house (each with a top view cross section of 50 m(2)) would lead to an annual reduction in carbon emissions from power plants of 16,000, 41,000, and 9000 t, respectively (the per-tree reduction in carbon emissions is about 10-11 kg per year). These reductions only account for the direct reduction in the net cooling- and heating-energy use of buildings. Once the impact of the community cooling is included, these savings are increased by at least 25%. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

144,WOS:000335121600003,"Global warming has been one of the major concerns behind the world's high-speed economic growth. How to implement the coordinated development of the carbon footprint and the economy will be the core issue of the world's economic and social development, as well as the heated debate of the research at home and abroad in recent years. Based on the energy consumption, integrated with the ""Top-Down"" life cycle approach and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, this paper analyzed the spatial differences and multi-mechanism of carbon footprint in provincial China in 2010. Firstly, this study calculated the amount of carbon footprint of each province using ""Top-Down"" life cycle approach and found that there were significant differences of carbon footprint and per capita carbon footprint in provincial China. The provinces with higher carbon footprint, mainly located in northern China, have large economic scales; the provinces with higher per capita carbon footprint are mainly distributed in central cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and energy-rich regions and heavy chemical bases. Secondly, with the aid of GIS and spatial analysis model (GWR model), this paper had unfolded that the expansion of economic scale is the main driver of the rapid growth of carbon footprint. The growth of population and urbanization also acted as promoting factors for the increase of the carbon footprint. Energy structure had no considerable promoting effect for the increase of the carbon footprint. Improving energy efficiency is the most important factor to inhibit the growing carbon footprint. Thirdly, developing low-carbon economies and low-carbon industries, as well as advocating low-carbon city construction and improving carbon efficiency would be the primary approaches to inhibit the rapid growth of carbon footprint. Moderately controlling the economic scale and population size would also be required to alleviate carbon footprint. Meanwhile, environmental protection and construction of low-carbon cities would evoke extensive attention in the process of urbanization.","Wang, SJ, Fang, CL, Ma, HT, Wang, Y, Qin, J",22,Shanghai; Beijing,CHN; CHN,10.1007/s11442-014-1109-z,SRID=4326;POINT (121.45806 31.22222); SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),22315474; 11716620,Spatial differences and multi-mechanism of carbon footprint based on GWR model in provincial China,2014

There is a need to establish baseline GHG emission accounting protocols that provide consistent, reproducible, comparable and holistic GHG accounts that incorporate in-boundary and transboundary GHG impacts of urban activities and support policy intervention. This article provides a synthesis of previously published GHG accounts for cities by organizing them according to their in-boundary and transboundary considerations, and reviewing three broad approaches that are emerging for city-scale GHG emissions accounting: geographic accounting, transboundary infrastructure supply chain (TBIS) footprinting, and consumption-based footprinting. The TBIS and consumption-based footprints are two different approaches that result in different estimates of a community's GHG emissions, and inform policies differently, as illustrated with a case study of Denver, CO, USA. The conceptual discussions around TBIS and consumption-based footprints indicate that one single metric (e.g., GHG/person) will probably not be suitable to represent GHG emissions associated with cities, and it will take a combination of variables for defining a low-carbon city.","Chavez, A, Ramaswami, A",37,Denver,USA,10.4155/CMT.11.38,SRID=4326;POINT (-104.9847 39.73915),682545,Progress toward low carbon cities: approaches for transboundary GHG emissions' footprinting,2011
146,WOS:000391539000001,"The climate warming effects of accelerated urbanization along with projected global climate change raise an urgent need for sustainable mitigation and adaptation strategies to cool urban climates. Our modeling results show that historical urbanization in the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas has increased daytime urban air temperature by 1.3 degrees C, in part due to a weakening of the onshore sea breeze circulation. We find that metropolis-wide adoption of cool roofs can meaningfully offset this daytime warming, reducing temperatures by 0.9 degrees C relative to a case without cool roofs. Residential cool roofs were responsible for 67% of the cooling. Nocturnal temperature increases of 3.1 degrees C from urbanization were larger than daytime warming, while nocturnal temperature reductions from cool roofs of 0.5 degrees C were weaker than corresponding daytime reductions. We further show that cool roof deployment could partially counter the local impacts of global climate change in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Assuming a scenario in which there are dramatic decreases in greenhouse gas emissions in the 21st century (RCP2.6), mid-and end-of-century temperature increases from global change relative to current climate are similarly reduced by cool roofs from 1.4 degrees C to 0.6 degrees C. Assuming a scenario with continued emissions increases throughout the century (RCP8.5), mid-century warming is significantly reduced by cool roofs from 2.0 degrees C to 1.0 degrees C. The end-century warming, however, is significantly offset only in small localized areas containing mostly industrial/commercial buildings where cool roofs with the highest albedo are adopted. We conclude that metropolis-wide adoption of cool roofs can play an important role in mitigating the urban heat island effect, and offsetting near-term local warming from global climate change. Global-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way of avoiding long-term warming, however. We further suggest that both climate mitigation and adaptation can be pursued simultaneously using 'cool photovoltaics'.","Vahmani, P, Sun, F, Hall, A, Ban-Weiss, G",3,Los Angeles; San Diego,USA; USA,10.1088/1748-9326/11/12/124027,SRID=4326;POINT (-118.24368 34.05223); SRID=4326;POINT (-117.15726 32.71533),3971883; 1394928,Investigating the climate impacts of urbanization and the potential for cool roofs to counter future climate change in Southern California,2016
147,WOS:000423002200074,"The urban bus fleet has been significantly expanded to satisfy an increasing demand for transit in Macau, highlighting the need for green transport. Electric public buses (EPBs) have been considered an effective strategy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by substituting them for diesel buses. However, the efficiency of EPBs to reduce GHG emissions varies significantly, due to local road conditions and transit operating characteristics. On the basis of the real-world tested data, this study performed a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) between traditional diesel public buses (TDPBs) and EPBs to evaluate the actual GHG emissions and their reduction. The results show that the mean GHG emissions per 100 km of diesel light duty buses, medium duty buses and heavy duty buses were approximately 47.18, 101.97, and 127.99 kg CO2 eq, respectively. The EPB5 supported by current electricity mixes exceed the emissions of corresponding TDPBs when considering the charging loss and electricity distribution loss. EPBs, therefore, would hardly reduce GHG emissions under the current situations. Due to the rapid growth in the number of urban buses, total GHG emissions from TDPBs in 2001-2015 experienced a rapid upward trend, increasing from 36.55 to 48.86 thousand tons CO2 eq. Scenario analysis for future EPB5 substitution implies that, if choosing the best charging efficiency and electricity distribution loss, EPB5 have the potential to significantly mitigate the GHG emissions from public buses, especially under the clean electricity mixes (like natural gases fired electricity and solar energy).

These risks include increased water scarcity, increased heat, and the introduction and emergence of vector-borne and other climate sensitive diseases. To respond to these threats, it is necessary for the government, at every level, to adopt more mitigation and adaptation strategies. Here, focus groups were conducted with representatives from five Lima municipalities to determine priorities, perception of climate change, and decision-making processes for implementing projects within each municipality. These factors can affect the ability and desire of a community to implement climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. The results show that climate change and other environmental factors are of relatively low priority, whereas public safety and water and sanitation services are of highest concern. Perhaps most importantly, climate change is not well understood among the municipalities. Participants had trouble distinguishing climate change from other environmental issues and did not fully understand its causes and effects. Greater understanding of what climate change is and why it is important is necessary for it to become a priority for the municipalities.

151,WOS:000256277100009,"This paper proposes a computationally efficient methodology for the optimal location and sizing of static and switched shunt capacitors in radial distribution systems. The problem is formulated as the maximization of the savings produced by the reduction in energy losses and the avoided costs due to investment deferral in the expansion of the network. The proposed method selects the nodes to be compensated, as well as the optimal capacitor ratings and their operational characteristics, i.e. fixed or switched. After an appropriate linearization, the optimization problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem, suitable for being solved by means of a widespread commercial package. Results of the proposed optimizing method are compared with another recent methodology reported in the literature using two test cases: a 15-bus and a 33-bus distribution network. For the both case's tested, the proposed methodology delivers better solutions indicated by higher loss savings, which are achieved with lower amounts of capacitive compensation. To calculate the energy savings and the deferral investment cost exactly, a load flow for radial distribution network is executed before and after the compensation. The proposed method has also been applied for compensating to an actual radial distribution network served by AES-Venezuela in the metropolitan area of Caracas. A convergence time of about 4 s after 22,298 iterations demonstrates the ability of the proposed methodology for efficiently handling compensation problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines two existing solar water heater installation projects with the aim of investigating the social contribution of the installation of solar water heaters in low-income households in South Africa. The Sustainable Urban Livelihoods approach (SULA) was adjusted to provide an analytical framework for the development of suitable indicators of social change in the context of renewable energies and energy poverty. Increases in household capital and the reduction of household vulnerability to shocks, stressors and seasonal variability as the result of solar water heater installation were investigated in projects in low-income housing developments in the cities of Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Data collected from paired household surveys (before and after installation) in over 600 households and qualitative information (Most Significant Change stories) show that the provision of a constant, cheap source of heated water contributed positively to the alleviation of energy poverty. Household capitals (categorised as Human, Social, Financial, Physical, Natural and Gender capital), including aspects such as health benefits and time and financial savings, were all positively effected by the installation of solar water heaters. In addition, improved energy security greatly reduced household vulnerability to shocks, stressors and seasonal variability.

The deployment of hydrogen fueling infrastructure to support the demonstration and commercialization of FCVs remains a critical barrier to transitioning to hydrogen as a transportation fuel. This study utilizes an engineering methodology referred to as the Spatially and Temporally Resolved Energy and Environment Tool (STREET) to demonstrate how systematic planning can optimize early investments in hydrogen infrastructure in a way that supports and encourages growth in the deployment of FCVs while ensuring that the associated environment and energy security benefits are fully realized. Specifically, a case study is performed for the City of Irvine, California - a target area for FCV deployment - to determine the optimized number and location of hydrogen fueling stations required to provide a bridge to FCV commercialization, the preferred rollout strategy for those stations, and the environmental impact associated with three near-term scenarios for hydrogen production and distribution associated with local and regional sources of hydrogen available to the City. Furthermore, because the State of California has adopted legislation imposing environmental standards for hydrogen production, results of the environmental impact assessment for hydrogen production and distribution scenarios are measured against the California standards. The results show that significantly fewer, hydrogen fueling stations are required to provide comparable service to the existing gasoline infrastructure, and that key community statistics are needed to inform the preferred rollout strategy for the stations. Well-to-wheel (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, urban criteria pollutants, energy use, and water use associated with hydrogen and FCVs can be significantly reduced in comparison to the average parc of gasoline vehicles regardless of whether hydrogen is produced and distributed with an emphasis on conventional resources (e.g., natural gas), or on local, renewable resources. An emphasis on local renewable resources to produce hydrogen further reduces emissions, energy use, and water use associated with hydrogen and FCVs compared to an emphasis on conventional resources. All three hydrogen production and distribution scenarios considered in the study meet California's standards for well-to-wheel GHG emissions, and well-to-tank emissions of urban ROG and NO(x). Two of the three scenarios also meet California's standard that 33% of hydrogen must be produced from renewable feedstocks.

Circular economy strategy is widely recognized as an effective way to achieve a low-carbon transition of cities through improved waste recycling and industrial symbiosis. However, the evidence of low-carbon benefit is less reported. While the carbon footprint (CFP) represents a mature tool responding to climate change concerns, limited studies have made use of CFP as a proxy for the performance of urban circular economy promotion. The aim of this paper is to investigate the CFP with a ten years span (2002-2012) of Guiyang, so as to understand how its circular economy practices have led to low-carbon benefits. Guiyang, one of China's national pilots of the Circular Economy (CE) City, the Low-Carbon City, as well as the Ecological Civilization City, has offered an ideal laboratory where the opportunities and challenges for a low-carbon urban transition can be explicitly discussed. A hybrid model that integrates an input-output (10) approach and process-based inventory analysis is developed to distinguish between direct carbon emissions of sectors from energy consumption, and indirect carbon emissions related to upstream and downstream flows both from production and consumption perspectives. The CFP of Guiyang in 2002, 2007 (after becoming the circular economy pilot) and 2012 (with implementation of urban industrial symbiosis) are analyzed by taking the 2002 as year of business as usual (BAU) scenario. Particularly, we identify scenarios related to proposed urban industrial symbiosis. Results imply that dramatic resource saving and CFP reductions could be achieved simultaneously. Changes to the CFP in 2002, 2007 and 2012 provide critical insights into the role of circular economy in speeding up urban transition towards a low-carbon society.

Therefore we were unable to find studies looking at both social interaction effects simultaneously. Consistent with earlier results, we find that households have a higher probability of possessing a vehicle if they are surrounded by other automobile-owning households (endogenous effect). However, we find that contextual effects are correctly measured only when the endogenous effect is included. In our case, everything else being equal, households in poorer neighborhoods are more likely to own vehicles, and households in neighborhoods with higher proportions of people with graduate degrees are less likely to own vehicles. This suggests that car ownership in New York City is a status symbol for poorer households and that non-car-ownership is a status symbol for people with post baccalaureate education. The results are important in two policy contexts: as auto ownership is a precursor to trip generation and mode choice, auto ownership estimation is important to effective travel forecasting; as vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is tied to auto ownership, VMT reduction strategies, as a way to improve air quality, reduce congestion, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, may depend on strategies to reduce auto ownership. In either case, correct modeling of auto ownership will lead to more effective policy outcomes.","Goetzke, F, Weinberger, R",19,New York City,USA,10.1068/a4490,SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),8175133,Separating contextual from endogenous effects in automobile ownership models,2012

Based on the modified Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model and on gray relational analysis, we analyzed the influence of land use changes on carbon sinks and emissions in Guangzhou from 2000 to 2012. The aim was to identify suitable options for built-up land expansion that would allow for minimal carbon losses. The key results were as follows: (1) Built-up land increased by 118.91% in Guangzhou city over the study period, with this expansion taking the form of concentric circles extending around the old Yuexiu district. (2) Carbon emissions over the period of analysis significantly exceeded carbon sink capabilities. The total carbon sink decreased by 30.02%, from 535.40 x 10(3) t to 374.6 x 10(3) t. Total carbon emissions increased by 1.89 times, from 13.73 x 10(6) t to 39.67 x 10(6) t; 80% of carbon emissions were derived from energy consumption. (3) There were large differences in the extent of carbon sink losses at different scales of built-up land expansion and land use change. In Guangzhou, the loss of carbon sink is small when cultivated land (though not prime farmland) and water bodies are converted to built-up land on a small scale. The loss of carbon sink is much smaller when grasslands are converted to built-up land on a large scale. However, forested land, which has excellent carbon sink functions, should not be converted. (4) Changes in carbon sinks were mainly affected by natural factors and land urbanization. Changes in carbon emissions were mainly affected by population urbanization, economic urbanization, and land urbanization. (5) To achieve ""economical and intensive use of land"", ""urban growth boundary"" and ""ecological red lines"" should be determined for government policies on land use management. These factors have great significance for ""increasing carbon sinks and reducing carbon emissions"" in urban ecological systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The main research goal was to compare the carbon footprint of a tricycle logistics service with that of a traditional urban logistics company. The tricycles use electric engines; traditional urban logistic companies use diesel-powered vehicles. Emissions associated with power and fuel consumption, along with vehicle and battery production, assembly, and disposal, were quantified. Real-world GPS and warehouse data were recorded to evaluate B-Line operations, and different scenarios were analyzed to assess emissions reductions. A conservative approach was taken to avoid overstating emissions savings. The results show that total greenhouse gas emissions, including B-line's and its partners' operations, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e), are reduced between 51% and 72%.

These daily activities, seemingly clean, need electric energy and they carry out a human-induced greenhouse gas emission. Generation of electricity has a significant effect on the inventory of emissions and environmental impacts due to the large differences in the power generation sources used. This paper aims to shed light on the methodological challenge and develop a necessary simplified methodology to illustrate the importance of the power generation mix in urban greenhouse emissions. The electrical mix is a figure that expresses the carbon emissions associated to the electrical power generation, so it is an indicator of the suitability of the sources used for electrical power production. The smaller the mix, the higher is the contribution of low carbon emission sources. The methodology is explained, applying it to Madrid, assessing the greenhouse gas emission per kWh of electricity generated.

Rates of being bullied were similar for males and females, but the forms of being bullied were different. Being bullied was significantly lower in Beijing than in the other 3 cities. There were significant psychosocial differences between students who had been bullied and students who had not been bullied. Students who had been involved in a physical fight, often felt lonely, or had considered suicide in the past 30 days were more likely to report being bullied. Students who thought that other students in their school were often kind and helpful, who felt parents often understood their troubles, or who were taught in school how to handle stress were less likely to report being bullied.

166,WOS:000398771100010,"Purpose The use of high levels of thermal insulation is a common practice towards reducing the energy consumption of the existing building stock; however, the embodied burdens associated with the additional insulation material are usually not taken into account and questions regarding the risks of over-specifying the insulation levels have been emerging, particularly for mild climate regions. This article addresses the issue presenting an integrated approach that combines life cycle assessment and thermal dynamic simulation to assess alternative retrofit strategies for the roof and exterior walls of two dwellings (from the beginning of the twentieth century), in the historic city center of Coimbra, Portugal. A comprehensive analysis of alternative insulation thicknesses (no insulation, 40, 80, and 120 mm of expanded polystyrene) was made to identify optimal thickness levels minimizing life cycle (LC) environmental impacts for a single-family house and an apartment. Methods Embodied and operational impact trade-offs were calculated for six impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and non-renewable primary energy. The operational energy was calculated using a dynamic thermal modeling software (EnergyPlus). The functional unit selected for this study was 1 m(2) of living area over a period of 50 years. Results and discussion The single-family house embodied impacts account for 26-57 % of total LC impacts. For insulation thicknesses larger than 80 mm, the embodied impacts are greater than operational impacts. For the apartment, embodied impacts account for 25-49 % of total LC impacts. The environmental benefits of additional insulation are very low (<3 %) for thicknesses of more than 80 mm for both roof and exterior walls. For thicknesses above the tipping point (where total LC impacts are minimized), the marginal impacts of additional insulation are higher than the benefits. The results for the apartment show that optimal insulation thicknesses (LC tipping point) range from 30 to 40 mm for the roof and from 60 to 80 mm for the exterior walls. The LC tipping point for the single-family house is achieved by combining 80-100 mm of roof insulation with 60-80 mm of exterior wall insulation. Conclusions Extra insulation levels in temperate climates can lead to higher embodied impacts, without significant reduction in operational impacts, which can result in higher total LC impacts.

This study develops an inexact bi-level linear programming (IBLP) model for collaborative control of GHG emissions and waste management in Beijing: MGU-MCL. The MGU-MCL model implies a leader-follower decision process, with the environmental sector providing the upper-level objective and the local authority dominating the lower-level objective. Then, an interactive fuzzy possiblistic approach is introduced to represent the satisfactory degrees of different decision-making levels. Results show that the MGU-MCL model decisions would reduce GHG emissions by about 9%, but increase management costs by 4% compared with the decisions from conventional models; the contribution of the landfill facilities to GHG emissions would be predominant, especially methane emissions; while the composting and incineration facilities would account for a large proportion of management cost.

This framework simultaneously considers two emission dependent factors, commuting demand and modal share based on the concept of excess commuting and accessibility analysis, and ensures its applicability to other cities where the detailed individual travel data is not available. A case study of Beijing from 2000 to 2009 is used to illustrate this framework. The findings suggest that changing urban form in Beijing did have a significant impact on commuting CO2 emission increase. Changing to a more decentralized urban form in Beijing had a larger impact on commuting distance and increased usage of cars, which resulted in a significant rise in CO2 emissions.

178,WOS:000357489700065,"Water is one of the primary resources provided for maintaining quality of life and social status in urban areas. As potable water is considered to be a primary need, water service has usually been managed without examining the economic and environmental sustainability of supply processes. Currently, due to increases in energy costs and the growth of environment preservation policies, reducing water leakage, energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) production have become primary objectives in reducing the environmental footprint of water service. The present paper suggests the implementation of some performance indicators that show the interdependence of water loss, energy consumption and GHG emission. These indicators are used to compare a few possible mitigation scenarios involving water loss reduction and increasing the system's energy efficiency. The proposed indicators were applied to a complex urban water supply system serving the city of Palermo (Italy).","Puleo, V, Sambito, M, Freni, G",6,Palermo,ITA,10.3390/en8065937,SRID=4326;POINT (13.33561 38.13205),648260,"An Environmental Analysis of the Effect of Energy Saving, Production and Recovery Measures on Water Supply Systems under Scarcity Conditions",2015

In New York's outer region car travel is four times per capita than what it is in its urban area. The comparative analyses are based on the UK National Travel Survey and the US National Household Travel Survey. The population outside Greater London' Green Belt and New York's periphery has been growing relentlessly since the 1950s. The transport structure of the South East of England and the New York Tri-State area has been largely shaped around the private car. Measures that aim to meet CO2 emission targets will need address the nature of the cardependent developments of London's and New York's growing outer fringe. The paper compares the current travel structure of the outer regions of the two cities that are nearly exclusively moulded around the motorcar. Using specially commissioned spatial breakdowns of the respective household travel survey data, detailed travel behaviour is analysed for both the urban and exurban areas. The data illustrates the stark contrast in mobility of the urban and exurban areas of the cities. Through an analysis of current vehicle use, estimates of CO2 emissions are made using established average emission factors per vehicle in each region. In our study of London and New York regions the exurban areas produce the bulk of car-based CO2 emissions: 77% for the London region and 87% for the New York region. Furthermore, using existing population forecasts and estimates of future average CO2 emissions per vehicle, future levels of CO2 emissions from private vehicles are estimated. Our estimates show that the CO2 emission reduction targets that have been set will not be met by a large margin.

In examining how experiments take effect, we suggest that we need to understand not only how they are made and assembled, but also how they are maintained within specific urban contexts. Drawing on literatures from urban political ecology and the specific debate on urban repair and maintenance, this article examines maintenance in two case studies of climate change experiments in housing in Bangalore (India) and Monterrey (Mexico). We find that maintenance is a crucial process through which not only urban obduracy is preserved, but also the novel and innovative character of the experiment is asserted and reproduced. The process of maintaining' experiments is a precarious one, which requires a continuous external input in terms of remaking the experiment materially and discursively. This process causes further reconfigurations beyond the experiment, changing the patterns of responsibility attribution and acceptability that configure the urban fabric.","Broto, VC, Bulkeley, H",32,Bengaluru; Monterrey,IND; MEX,10.1111/1468-2427.12050,SRID=4326;POINT (77.59369 12.97194); SRID=4326;POINT (-100.31847 25.67507),5104047; 1122874,Maintaining Climate Change Experiments: Urban Political Ecology and the Everyday Reconfiguration of Urban Infrastructure,2013
181,WOS:000303567600005,"With rapidly deteriorating national and local economies, many urban dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa are resorting to informal sector activities to ameliorate the current food insecurity that poor households face. Among these activities is urban agriculture, which is used both as a source of basic foodstuffs and also for income generation. In many cities, the growing of food crops is considered as an activity for rural areas, and is therefore, excluded from urban development and planning policy. This state of affairs has traditionally presented major challenges for many small-scale urban farmers to realise their full potential and attain household food security. In recent years, changes in climatic conditions (e.g. drought and flooding), coupled with a lack of policies supporting the activities of the urban poor, have combined to make it difficult for households to adapt to the changing urban environment. Drawing upon recent field-based research in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, the paper explores the relationships between urban livelihoods and extreme weather events, and evaluates the extent to which changes in climate and urban governance are impacting upon urban agriculture.

182,WOS:000334130900045,"Knowledge of the factors driving greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cities is crucial to mitigating China's anthropogenic emissions. In this paper, the main drivers increasing GHG emissions from the Chinese city of Suzhou between 2005 and 2010 were identified and quantitatively analyzed using the Kaya identity and the log-mean Divisia index method. We found that economy and population were the major drivers of GHG emissions in Suzhou, having contributed 162.20% and 109.04%, respectively, to the increase in emissions. A decline in carbon intensity, which was caused by the declining energy intensity and an adjustment to the mixture of power and industrial structures, was the major determinant and accounted for a reduction of 171.24% in GHG emissions. Slowing and maintaining healthy growth rates of economy and population could be the primary and most effective means if Suzhou tries to curb the total emissions over the short term. It may be more realistic for Suzhou to control emissions by optimizing the economic structure for low-carbon industrial development because of the city's relative high energy requirements and low potential to mitigate GHGs by adjusting the energy mixture.

183,WOS:000392659700005,"Relative to the rest of the United States, the region of southwestern Pennsylvania, including metropolitan Pittsburgh, experiences high ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is known to be associated with adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health impacts. This study evaluates whether the closing of three coal-fired power plants within the southwestern Pennsylvania region resulted in a significant decrease in PM2.5 concentration. Both PM2.5 data obtained from EPA ground stations in the study region and aerosol optical depth (AOD) data retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites were used to investigate regional air quality from January 2011 through December 2014. The impact of the plant closings on PM2.5 concentration and AOD was evaluated using a series of generalized additive models. The model results show that monthly fuel consumption of the Elrama plant, which closed in October of 2012, and monthly fuel consumption of both the Mitchell and Hatfield's Ferry plants, which closed in October of 2013, were significant predictors of both PM2.5 concentration and AOD at EPA ground stations in the study region, after controlling for multiple meteorological factors and long-term, region-wide air quality improvements. The model's power to predict PM2.5 concentration increased from an adjusted R-2 of 0.61 to 0.68 after excluding data from ground stations with higher uncertainty due to recent increases in unconventional natural gas extraction activities. After preliminary analyses of mean PM2.5 concentration and AOD showed a downward trend following each power plant shutdown, results from a series of generalized additive models confirmed that the activity of the three plants that closed, measured by monthly fuel consumption, was highly significant in predicting both AOD and PM2.5 at 12 EPA ground stations; further research on PM2.5 emissions from unconventional natural gas extraction is needed. Implications: With many coal-fired power plants scheduled to close across the United States in the coming years, there is interest in the potential impact on regional PM2.5 concentrations. In southwestern Pennsylvania, recent coal-fired power plant closings were coupled with a boom in unconventional natural gas extraction. Natural gas is currently seen as an economically viable bridge fuel between coal and renewable energy.

The concentration of SO(4)(2-) was higher than the most polluted cities abroad, indicating Shanghai has been a severe polluted city over the world. The high coal/fuel consumption from urbanization and the rapid increase of vehicles resulted in the high emission of SO(2) and NO(x), the precursor of the high concentration of acidic ions, SO(4)(2-) and NO(3)(-) which were the main reason of the severe acid rain in Shanghai. The major ions showed clear temporal variations with higher concentrations of SO(4)(2-), NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+) and Ca(2+) in spring/winter, of Na(+), Cl(-), K(+), and Mg(2+) in autumn, and the lowest of all the ions in summer.

190,WOS:000342632300002,"Cities around the world are increasingly involved in climate action and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, in the context of responding to climate pressures in the water sector, very few studies have investigated the impacts of changing water use on GHG emissions, even though water resource adaptation often requires greater energy use. Consequently, reducing GHG emissions, and thus focusing on both mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change in planning and managing urban water supply systems, is necessary. Furthermore, the minimization of GHG emissions is likely to conflict with other objectives. Thus, applying a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), which can evolve an approximation of entire trade-off (Pareto) fronts of multiple objectives in a single run, would be beneficial. Consequently, the main aim of this paper is to incorporate GHG emissions into a MOEA framework to take into consideration both adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change for a city's water supply system. The approach is applied to a case study based on Adelaide's southern water supply system to demonstrate the framework's practical management implications. Results indicate that trade-offs exist between GHG emissions and risk-based performance, as well as GHG emissions and economic cost. Solutions containing rainwater tanks are expensive, while GHG emissions greatly increase with increased desalinated water supply. Consequently, while desalination plants may be good adaptation options to climate change due to their climate-independence, rainwater may be a better mitigation response, albeit more expensive.

191,WOS:000395134800001,"In this study, we propose a novel approach to describe the scattering effects of atmospheric aerosols in a complex urban environment using water vapor (H2O) slant column measurements in the near infrared. This approach is demonstrated using measurements from the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the top of Mt. Wilson, California, and a two-stream-exact single scattering (2S-ESS) radiative transfer (RT) model. From the spectral measurements, we retrieve H2O slant column density (SCD) using 15 different absorption bands between 4000 and 8000 cm(-1). Due to the wavelength dependence of aerosol scattering, large variations in H2O SCD retrievals are observed as a function of wavelength. Moreover, the variations are found to be correlated with aerosol optical depths (AODs) measured at the AERONET-Caltech station. Simulation results from the RT model reproduce this correlation and show that the aerosol scattering effect is the primary contributor to the variations in the wavelength dependence of the H2O SCD retrievals. A significant linear correlation is also found between variations in H2O SCD retrievals from different bands and corresponding AOD data; this correlation is associated with the asymmetry parameter, which is a first-order measure of the aerosol scattering phase function. The evidence from both measurements and simulations suggests that wavelength-dependent aerosol scattering effects can be derived using H2O retrievals from multiple bands. This understanding of aerosol scattering effects on H2O retrievals suggests a promising way to quantify the effect of aerosol scattering on greenhouse gas retrievals and could potentially contribute towards reducing biases in greenhouse gas retrievals from space.",,1,Wilson,USA,10.5194/acp-17-2495-2017,SRID=4326;POINT (-77.91553999999999 35.72127),49643,Aerosol scattering effects on water vapor retrievals over the Los Angeles Basin,2017

The case studies were conducted in which various ventilation systems were compared, such as a general ventilation system, a heat pump desiccant system (HPDS), and the proposed system combined with HPDS. Each system is operated with a conventional variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air-conditioning system in office buildings in each of the four cities (Sapporo, Tokyo, Kagoshima, and Matsumoto) in Japan. We evaluate three systems with a VRF system for potential energy savings under different weather conditions (hot, cold, hot and humid, cold and dry or different).

And there is little research on the structural analysis of the upstream supply chain for Scope 3. However, a comprehensive urban GHG accounting system is the basis for cities to make appropriate mitigation measures. Identifying the main embodied GHG that dominate the emissions in upstream supply chains can help focus attention on the largest emitters and offer insights into where climate mitigation efforts should be directed. Thus, in this study the Economic Input Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) approach was used to evaluate the embodied GHG emissions from Scope 3 and to explore the related GHG emissions structure in the upstream supply chain based on the final demand for the key urban materials. And food, water, steel, cement, and fuel were selected as the representative urban materials based on the characteristic of Xiamen City. Our results demonstrate that the total embodied GHG emissions were 13,201.31 kt CO(2)e, very close to the direct GHG emissions from end-use sectors inside Xiamen city.

In the process of industrialization and urbanization of China, emissions from transport sector would continuously increase. In order to investigate the emissions and reduction potential and provide the policy guidance for policymakers in China's transport sector, this study decomposed the CO2 emissions using the Kaya identity, calculated the contribution based on the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to explore the underlying determinants of emissions change, and then constructed different scenarios to predict the emissions and estimate the potential of emission reduction in the future. Results indicated that carbon emissions in China's transport sector have increased from 123.14 Mt in 1995 to 670.76 Mt in 2012. Income effect is the dominant factor that results in the increase of emissions while energy intensity effect is the main driving force to lower carbon emissions. The transportation modal shifting, transportation intensity change, and population growth have the positive but relatively minor impact on emissions. The accumulated emission reduction is expected to be 1825.97 Mt, which is 3 times more than the emissions in 2010. Policy recommendations are thus put forward for future emission reduction.","Li, W, Li, H, Zhang, HX, Sun, S",1,Kaya,BFA,10.1155/2016/1043717,SRID=4326;POINT (-1.08444 13.09167),39229,The Analysis of CO2 Emissions and Reduction Potential in China's Transport Sector,2016
197,WOS:000353091600012,"The carbon balance in urban areas has become a major research challenge and a principal policy concern in efforts to address anthropogenic climate change. Rapid urbanization and industrialization in China urge the search for integrated strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which not only limit to traditional infrastructure sectors, but also cover urban green infrastructure, because plants and soils function as carbon sinks through biotic sequestration. This study presents a nationwide study about how urban green infrastructure could contribute to the carbon balance in 35 major Chinese cities. By the end of 2010, the total area of urban green spaces (the dominant components of urban green infrastructure) accounts for 6.38% of the total land area of these cities and represented 51.7% of the total urban green spaces of all 657 cities in China. Based on empirical data from the literature, the total amount of carbon stored in the vegetation of the urban green infrastructure of 35 cities was estimated at 18.7 million tons, with an average carbon density of 21.34 t/ha. In 2010, the amount of carbon sequestration totaled 1.90 million tons with an average carbon sequestration rate of 2.16 t/ha/year. Collectively, only 0.33% of the carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion can be offset, ranging from 0.01% in Hohhot to 22.45% in Haikou. Nevertheless, the dominance of young vegetation stands in Chinese urban green infrastructure suggests this small carbon sequestration efficiency could become substantial in the near future, given that appropriate policies and management practices are adopted to promote urban green infrastructure for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

This paper defines and adopts the principle of equal historical cumulative emissions per capita, and uses Shanghai as a case study to build an allocation standard for carbon emissions. First, using China's emission reduction targets, we established the carbon emission space for 2020, then constructed an allocation standard for Shanghai carbon emissions for 2020. We found that Shanghai's total carbon emissions between 2000 and 2013 had exceeded China's average carbon emissions, driven by a traditional economic development model. These results point to the necessity of reducing carbon emissions from 2011 levels effectively. The carbon emission per capita has become increasingly faster since 2012.

203,WOS:000393346800028,"Estimating cooling and heating energy requirements is an integral part of designing and managing buildings. Further, as buildings are among the largest energy consumers in cities, the estimates are important for formulating effective energy conservation strategies. Where complex hourly simulation models are not favored, such estimates may be derived by simplified methods that are less computationally intensive but still provide results that are reasonably close to those obtained from the more complicated approach. The equivalent full load hours (EFLH) method is a simplified energy estimation method that has recently gained popularity. It offers a straightforward means of evaluating energy efficiency programs. However, to date, easily accessible EFLH data exist only for a very limited number of countries in North America and Europe, but not Asia. This current work provides previously unavailable monthly EFLH data for building cooling and heating in three large Asian cities, viz. Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo. To assess the effects of changing temperature over the course of decades on building cooling and heating energy consumption, EFLH data are calculated for three time periods: past (1983-2005), present (2006-2014) and future (2015-2044). The projections for the future time period are based on the climate scenarios Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. RCP-4.5 assumes a stabilization of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions followed by a reduction, while RCP-8.5 assumes their further increase. From the EFLH data, considering just the effects of ambient temperature changes, it is projected the total energy required to heat and/or cool residential dwellings in Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo to increase by 18.3%, 4% and 10.4%, respectively over 62 years from 1983 to 2044 in the case of RCP-4.5, and by 23.3%, 9.3% and 15.8%, respectively in the case of RCP-8.5. This shows that even with future stabilization and reduction of GHG emissions, as per scenario RCP-4.5, the energy needs of the three cities for building heating and cooling combined can be expected to increase over the next few decades. This has significant implications, namely increased demands for additional primary energy, which will result in further GHG emissions. These effects, however, can be controlled with adjustments to the electricity fuel mix of each location, and also by use of more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) devices.

Scenario analysis, combined with a regional carbon emission model, was used to evaluate whether the current government goals are realistic. We first set reasonable scenarios for factors in the model that have important effects on carbon emissions, and then forecast the carbon emissions for a given region. Reasonable regional carbon reduction goals were obtained based on these forecasts. In Beijing, eleven kinds of development scenarios were considered, and their effects on carbon reduction goals were analyzed. Results showed that future CO2 emissions in Beijing will rise markedly, whereas carbon intensity will reduce gradually, causing the rate of carbon reduction to slow over the long term. We found that an 18% reduction in carbon intensity for Beijing during the 12th Five-Year Plan is a reasonable goal, whereas a 45%-50% reduction from 2005 to 2020 is also realistic. Moreover, the carbon intensity in Beijing could be reduced by 12%-16% during the 13th Five-Year Plan and by a further 12% during the 14th Five-Year Plan.

208,WOS:000368206800021,"Rising pressure of population growth and economic development, limited energy supplies, and improved concerns over environmental effects have forced decision makers to contemplate comprehensive optimization of urban energy systems planning. A multi-objective optimization model at urban sector scale is proposed in this study to achieve sustainable development of energy, economic, and environmental systems, by integrating objectives of minimal energy consumption, energy cost, and environmental impact. To comprehensively measure the environmental objective, the life cycle assessment method is used to calculate the environmental impact caused by various pollutants in the chain of energy production, transportation, and consumption. Based on the 1995-2010 data, the optimization model is applied to Beijing, China to obtain a reasonable solution of energy mix in 2015 and 2020, where the four energy resources (i.e., coal, oil, natural gas, and electricity which account for over 96% of the total energy consumption) are distributed to the six key sectors (agriculture, industry, construction, transportation, commerce, and household). The results estimate a decline in the proportion of coal to the total energy consumption and an increase for others. The decrease in energy consumption is only observed in the industry sector. It also found that the effect of energy savings and emissions reduction when considering the environmental impact is better than that neglecting the environmental impact. It concludes that the multi-objective optimization model integrating environmental impact is useful for reasonable allocation of energy resources across the urban sectors, which could help balance economic, energy and environmental goals and provide more detailed and practical support for urban energy system management.

Electricity was produced in each scenario. Data from the City of Toronto was used to undertake this study. Results showed that the waste diversion initiatives were more effective in reducing the organic portion of the waste, in turn, reducing the net electricity production of the landfill while increasing the net electricity production of the incinerator. Therefore, the scenario that incorporated incineration performed better environmentally and contributed overall to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions because of the displacement of power plant emissions; however, at a noticeably higher cost.

This paper aims to estimate the energy saving efficiency of EV, especially under different EV penetration and road traffic conditions. First, based on the emission and electricity consumption data collected by a light-duty EV and a light duty GV, a set of electricity consumption rate models and gasoline consumption rate models are established. Then, according to the conversion formula of coal equivalent, these models are transformed into coal equivalent consumption models, which make gasoline consumption and electricity consumption comparable. Finally, the relationship between the EV penetration and the reduction of energy consumption is explored based on the simulation undertaken on the North Second Ring Road in Beijing. The results show that the coal equivalent consumption will decrease by about 5% with the increases of EV penetration by 10% and the maximum energy-saving effect can be achieved when the traffic volume is about 4000 pcu/h.","Yao, EJ, Lang, ZF, Song, YY, Yang, Y, Zuo, T",2,Beijing,CHN,10.1155/2013/435721,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,Microscopic Driving Parameters-Based Energy-Saving Effect Analysis under Different Electric Vehicle Penetration,2013

The production of plants offers many benefits in the social and environmental spheres: it generates employment, improves the landscape and gives a contribution to carbon dioxide accumulation. On the other hand, nurseries are considered intensive agricultural systems, responsible for soil erosion, waste production, and soil, air and water pollution. The research presented in this paper aimed to quantify the environmental impact, in terms of GHG (Green House Gases) emissions of different nursery typologies (in-pot and in-field grown plants) and productions (small, medium and large size plants). For this reason, a LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) approach was carried out in seven different nurseries on eleven production lines. GWP (Global Warming Potential) was the impact category chosen for this analysis, and the square meter was used as functional unit to represent the differences between nursery and plant typologies, although data for ""product"" unit are shown as well. Results show that in-pot systems, with an emissions range of 7.444-26.489 kg of CO2-e are much more impacting than in-field grown production processes (0.607-1.013 kg of CO2-e). Such great differences are mainly due to the peat used in substrate mixes and the plastic used for pots, indeed these are the most important sources of GHG emissions, and are widely used in in-pot production, while they are not present in infield processes.

215,WOS:000395831200022,"With the gradual deployment of smart meters in many cities around the world, new opportunities arise in reducing energy usage and improving consumers' information and control on their electricity consumption. Central to the provision of these newer services is the ability to accurately forecast the electricity demand of individual households. Compared with load forecasting at the city level and larger system aggregates, load forecasting for individual households is a much harder problem as the loads are much more stochastic and volatile. In this paper, we study the use of sparse coding for modeling and forecasting these individual household electricity loads. The proposed methods are tested on a data set of 5000 households in a joint project with electric power board of Chattanooga, for the period from September 2011 to August 2013. We obtain 10% improvements in the accuracy of forecasting next-day total load and next-week total load when we add sparse code features in ridge regression in this difficult problem. We also evaluate more classical forecasting methods on this forecasting problem, including autoregressive integrated moving average and Holt-Winters smoothing.",,1,Davao; Chattanooga,PHL; USA,10.1109/TSG.2015.2513900,SRID=4326;POINT (125.61278 7.07306); SRID=4326;POINT (-85.30968 35.04563),1212504; 176588,A Sparse Coding Approach to Household Electricity Demand Forecasting in Smart Grids,2017

Because of global warming and energy prices designers are refocusing on the low carbon credentials of new equivalents. In this context, the main target of the proposed study is to present a new innovative method of cooling the non-refrigerator medicine storage warehouses in order to minimize energy costs and environmental hazards for the city of Yazd in Iran. For this purpose, warehouses with absorption chillers, underground warehouses, and underground warehouses including wind catchers have been analyzed. Then, the equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC) method was applied for evaluating the costs of the three alternative systems. The results of this study show that the use of wind catcher is far more economical than the absorption chiller cooling system. Moreover, it is concluded that the construction of an underground warehouse with a wind catcher is the most economical option for the storage of medicines than the other warehouses in this case study.

217,WOS:000377921800074,"Coal-fired combustion is recognized as a significant anthropogenic source of atmospheric compounds in Beijing, causing heavy air pollution events and associated deterioration in visibility. Obtaining an accurate understanding of the temporal trends and spatial variation characteristics of emissions from coal-fired industrial combustion is essential for predicting air quality changes and evaluating the effectiveness of current control measures. In this study, an integrated emission inventory of primary air pollutants emitted from coal-fired industrial boilers in Beijing is developed for the period of 2007-2013 using a technology-based approach. Future emission trends are projected through 2030 based on current energy-related and emission control policies. Our analysis shows that there is a general downward trend in primary air pollutants emissions because of the implementation of stricter local emission standards and the promotion by the Beijing municipal government of converting from coal-fired industrial boilers to gas-fired boilers. However, the ratio of coal consumed by industrial boilers to total coal consumption has been increasing, raising concerns about the further improvement of air quality in Beijing. Our estimates indicate that the total emissions of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOx, CO and VOCs from coal-fired industrial boilers in Beijing in 2013 are approximately 19,242 t, 13,345 t, 26,615 t, 22,965 t, 63,779 t and 1406 t, respectively. Under the current environmental policies and relevant energy savings and emission control plans, it may be possible to reduce NOx and other air pollutant emissions by 94% and 90% by 2030, respectively, if advanced flue gas purification technologies are implemented and coal is replaced with natural gas in the majority of existing boilers.

This paper aims to provide a new analytical framework for conflicts of interest between such measures. The framework is applied to climate change and biodiversity (including ecosystem) conservation law as well as thereon based measures and tested on the example of a city embedded in different geopolitical governance levels. The analysis is based on an in-depth literature review and develops an analytical framework in particular grounded upon differentiations between actions and inactions as well as between voluntary and compulsory activities. When testing this framework for the Viennese case, the authors systematically discuss the different types of Viennese endangered habitat types especially according to their required legal and other governance interventions, particularly under the climate change related forest law regime and biodiversity conservation law (both especially against the background of the Natura 2000 scheme of the European Union). The paper explains the logic and structure of the new framework and describes its theoretical applicability on conflicts of interests in general.

A challenge is that urban governance is not simply urban, but a complex assemblage of institutions, networks and socio-technical arrangements. There are several on-going literature debates discussing the different types of processes in which cities are involved. I disaggregate these into vertical processes (multilevel governance perspectives), horizontal processes (network and policy mobility perspectives), and what I term infrastructural processes (steering by conditions in the built environment). The purpose of the article is to show how all these types of governance processes combine to drive urban low-carbon energy transitions. Using the notion of policy assemblage, I outline a framework through which the different types of governance processes can be reconciled. This is illustrated through a discussion of how the different types of processes interact in the context of urban low-carbon mobility in Europe. A discussion of the case of Stavanger, Norway, shows how different types of governance processes combine to drive and constrain low-carbon energy transitions and underlines the importance of taking seriously the constraints of the built environment.

220,WOS:000418984900002,"As a powerful dynasty ruling northern China from 386 to 534 CE, the Northern Wei dynasty unexpectedly moved its capital from Pingcheng to Luoyang in 494 CE. This move has great significance in Chinese history, and the reasons for it have aroused intense and long-lasting controversy. To explore the environmental factors underlying this event, this study focuses on the impact of natural disasters on Pingcheng in the fifth century based on continuous high-resolution paleoclimatic data combined with extensive historical records. It finds that Pingcheng experienced a significant decline in the late 470s CE as a result of continuous droughts and a low-temperature environment. Moreover, it is argued that the rapid growth of the population in Pingcheng might have increased its societal vulnerability to natural disasters. By comparing the food systems and geographical locations of Pingcheng and Luoyang, this study suggests that the relocation of the capital should be considered as an adaptation to climate change and a mitigation of its effects by the Northern Wei dynasty. In addition, the paper shows that other important cities along latitude 40 degrees N in East Asia also stopped growing during this period of rapid climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking as reference case an urban area that aims to become Sustainable Community, several initiatives have been assessed. Two target years, 2020 and 2050, have been analysed with the aid of Energy Plan, an integrated energy system model based on the hourly energy demand and supply able to consider constraints deriving from grid stability. The effects of climate change, defined by a regional climate model, have been analysed in the long-term scenario. The work focuses on the impact of a high share of micro-generation technologies for satisfying the energy demand of the building sector, following an original comprehensive approach that helps a better understanding of the implication of such low carbon policy. Both solar devices and micro-combined heat and power systems have been taken into account, the latter covering different technologies (i.e. internal combustion engines, Stirling engines, microturbines and fuel cells). Results show that the use of a high share of micro-generation technologies can help to reduce CO2 emissions and enable an increase in large-scale intermittent renewable production, only if a coordinated local energy plan combined with an optimal operation strategy is pursued. Moreover the work outlines the importance of developing an integrated energy system for introducing such technologies that can help to: (i) decarbonise the building sector, (ii) increase energy security and iii) postpone the investments in new network capacity.

It is particularly important that rapidly expanding cities establish scientific and comprehensive evaluation indexes for low-carbon logistics in order to accurately and quickly determine their logistics development situation. This paper develops an evaluation index system, especially including low carbon technological progress, and applies the entropy weight method to calculate the weights of indicators using the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework, thus avoiding the defects of weighting indicators determined subjectively in a multi-index evaluation. The results show that Beijing's logistics development is lower than that of comparable cities. The driving force is strong, but the pressure is weak. The ""state"" and ""impact"" factor scores indicate that the per capita increases in the logistics industry's fixed asset investment and telecommunications business as well as consistent investments in labour and the implementation of logistics emissions standards have improved the development of Beijing's low-carbon logistics.

The two estimated emissions are set up for comparison. The results show that the WWTP system emits 7.3 kg CO(2)-eq to remove 1 kg BUD in the studied life cycle, while the VSSF system only emits 3.18 kg CO(2)-eq, which is only half of the amount given off by the WWTP system. Especially at the treatment stage, the WWTP system's GHG emissions are almost 7 times higher than the VSSF system's. N(2)O emissions in both systems are only a minor fraction of the total emissions. Therefore, this study has concluded that the VSSF system is an effective option for GHG emissions mitigation in the wastewater sector. The study further suggests that developing countries like China should extensively build up VSSF systems for decentralized wastewater treatment, which could also potentially reduce GHG emissions by 8-17 million ton CO(2)-eq per year compared with the centralized scenario.

Several years of measured weather and PM2.5 concentration data were used to perform statistical and dynamic thermal and airflow simulation analysis. The statistical analysis confirmed that most PM2.5 is locally generated. Higher PM2.5 levels occur in the morning, when wind speeds are low and commuter traffic is high. Unfortunately, in most of the analyzed cities, most hours when daytime weekday outdoor temperatures are mild have elevated PM2.5 levels (up to 95% of the hours). The simulation analysis shows that a hybrid NV system can reduce the electricity consumption of a well-designed office building by up to 60%, in comparison to an office using only mechanical HVAC equipped with a high-efficiency particle filter. Unfortunately, in this hybrid approach, elevated outdoor PM2.5 levels penetrate into the working environment and increase occupant cumulative exposure by 1.9-4.2 times (compared to the standard HVAC system). Limiting the use of NV to moments of low outdoor PM2.5 concentrations limits the exposure increase to 1.3 to 2.4 times but reduces the maximum energy savings to 40%. The last part of this study analyses the tradeoff between energy savings and increased exposure, revealing that in Antwerp, Lisbon and Paris most NV-related energy savings occur in moments of low outdoor PM2.5 levels, thereby limiting the increased exposure effects that occur when unfiltered NV air enters into the working environment.

236,WOS:000328310000005,"Economic development in Indonesia has improved the people's welfare. As a result, household electricity consumption has risen continuously over the years. Indonesia's people come from a variety of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, which are steeped in several distinct regions. However, less attention has traditionally been paid to how household electricity consumption is influenced by local cultures. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of household electricity consumption and its driving factors under a variety of cultural backgrounds in a society plays an important role in designing proper regulations related to household energy savings. Two cities with different cultural backgrounds were selected for this study, namely Bandung and Yogyakarta. The factors driving electricity consumption are investigated using a field survey and classified according to how the electricity is used and the societal and economic characteristics. The relationships between electrical consumption and its driving factors are evaluated using multivariate data analysis. The results show that in Bandung, family size, time spent at home, education level, home appliances and lighting had a significant, positive effect on the monthly electricity bill. On the other hand, in Yogyakarta, education level and time spent at home had a negative impact on the monthly electricity bill. Based on these results, an energy conservation policy may not be generalisable but will have to be specified based on local characteristics to ensure that the policy is broadly adopted by society.

In new high quality buildings in particular, where these two latter aspects have been already implemented at the design stage, users' perspective, obtained through post-occupancy assessment, has to be considered to reduce whole energy requirement during service life. This research presents an innovative and low-cost methodology to reduce buildings' energy requirements through post-occupancy assessment and optimization of energy operations using effective users' attitudes and requirements as feedback. As a meaningful example, the proposed method is applied to a multipurpose building located in New York City, NY, USA, where real occupancy conditions are assessed. The effectiveness of the method is tested through dynamic simulations using a numerical model of the case study, calibrated through real monitoring data collected on the building. Results show that, for the chosen case study, the method provides optimized building energy operations which allow a reduction of primary energy requirements for HVAC, lighting, room-electricity, and auxiliary supply by about 21%.

This study aimed to quantify the association between climate variation and notified cases of HFMD in selected cities of Shanxi Province, and to provide evidence for disease control and prevention. Meteorological variables and HFMD cases data in 4 major cities (Datong, Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng) of Shanxi province, China, were obtained from the China Meteorology Administration and China CDC respectively over the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. Correlations analyses and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were used to identify and quantify the relationship between the meteorological variables and HFMD. HFMD incidence varied seasonally with the majority of cases in the 4 cities occurring from May to July. Temperatures could play important roles in the incidence of HFMD in these regions. The SARIMA models indicate that a 1 degrees C rise in average, maximum and minimum temperatures may lead to a similar relative increase in the number of cases in the 4 cities. The lag times for the effects of temperatures were identified in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng. The numbers of cases were positively associated with average and minimum temperatures at a lag of 1 week in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng, and with maximum temperature at a lag of 2 weeks in Yuncheng. Positive association between the temperature and HFMD has been identified from the 4 cities in Shanxi Province, although the role of weather variables on the transmission of HFMD varied in the 4 cities.

239,WOS:000282130100008,"Problem: Human and natural systems will probably have to adapt to climate change impacts, but this cannot be planned for using the traditional approach based on predictions because of the subject's great complexity, its planning horizon more than 50 years away, and uncertainty about the future climate and how effectively CO2 emissions will be reduced. Purpose: This article proposes a more appropriate basis for planning climate change adaptation. Anticipatory governance is a flexible decision framework that uses a wide range of possible futures to prepare for change and to guide current decisions toward maximizing future alternatives or minimizing future threats. Rather than trying to tame or ignore uncertainty, this approach explores uncertainty and its implications for current and future decision making. Methods: I review and summarize the literature on anticipatory governance and provide three case studies to demonstrate its application to climate change planning. Results and conclusions: Denver Water, New York City, and the City of Phoenix are all using scenarios to anticipate the range of global climate changes that may impact their communities and to develop adaptation strategies to address these impacts. Each is developing a decision framework for implementing adaptation strategies incrementally based on climate monitoring. An incremental approach minimizes the resources that must be allocated to address these risks and has allowed these cities to plan in spite of the high uncertainty associated with climate change science and social change. Takeaway for practice: The complexity, uncertainty, and distant planning horizon associated with climate change cannot be managed sufficiently for the traditional predict-and-plan approach to yield good decisions about the significant social and capital investments likely to be required for adaptation. To be successful, social institutions must embrace new methods that explore uncertainty and that provide strategic guidance for current and future decisions.

Design A negative binomial regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine city-specific temperature effects on IHD mortality up to 20 lag days. A meta-analysis was used to pool the cold effects and hot effects across the five cities. Patients 16 559 IHD deaths were monitored by a sentinel surveillance system in five cities during 2004-2008. Results The relationships between temperature and IHD mortality were non-linear in all five cities. The minimum-mortality temperatures in northern cities were lower than in southern cities. In Beijing, Tianjin and Guangzhou, the effects of extremely cold temperatures were delayed, while Shanghai and Wuhan had immediate cold effects. The effects of extremely hot temperatures appeared immediately in all the cities except Wuhan. Meta-analysis showed that IHD mortality increased 48% at the 1st percentile of temperature (extremely cold temperature) compared with the 10th percentile, while IHD mortality increased 18% at the 99th percentile of temperature (extremely hot temperature) compared with the 90th percentile. Conclusions Results indicate that both extremely cold and hot temperatures increase IHD mortality in China. Each city has its characteristics of heat effects on IHD mortality.

Remotely sensed data offer considerable benefits for addressing this lack of information. The aim of this paper is to develop and apply an approach that combines airborne LiDAR and QuickBird to assess the carbon stored in urban trees of Berlin, Germany, and to identify differences between urban structure types. For a transect in the city, dendrometric parameters were first derived to estimate individual tree stem diameter and carbon storage with allometric equations. Field survey data were used for validation. Then, the individual tree carbon storage was aggregated at the level of urban structure types and the distribution of carbon storage was analysed. Finally, the results were extrapolated to the entire urban area. High accuracies of the detected tree locations were reached with 65.30% for all trees and 80.1% for dominant trees. The total carbon storage of the study area was 20,964.40 t (sigma = 15,550.11 t). Its carbon density equaled 13.70 t/ha.

An economic input-output life-cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) model is applied to estimate the energy use and GHG emissions associated with the manufacture of construction materials for infrastructure. Operational requirements for dwellings and transportation are estimated using nationally and/or regionally averaged data. The results indicate that the most targeted measures to reduce GHG emissions in an urban development context should be aimed at transportation emissions, while the most targeted measures to reduce energy usage should focus on building operations. The results also show that low-density suburban development is more energy and GHG intensive (by a factor of 2.0-2.5) than high-density urban core development on a per capita basis.

The energy structure of China, dominated by coal, has caused serious problems, such as resource depletion, environmental pollution, and climate change. These problems have posed severe challenges to the sustainable development of mega-cities such as Shanghai. In order to ensure security of energy supply and alleviate the corresponding environmental pollution, these cities should effectively restructure their energy supply. This paper quantitatively analyzed the future energy consumption demand in Shanghai and its effects on environmental quality based on the MARKAL model with the aim of providing theoretical support for the government decision regarding energy policy, energy technology, adjustment of energy supply structure, etc. Different scenarios have been set up in light of the natural gas distributed supply system, clean and efficient coal-fired power technologies, energy-saving of industrial boilers technologies, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (advanced power generation technology), and wind power technologies. The results obtained by the MARKAL model show that total consumption of the whole society energy in Shanghai will reach 143 572 700 tons of standard coal in 2015, and 199 645 800 tons of standard coal in 2020. Thus, the future demand for energy consumption is huge astronomical, with about an average annual growth rate of 4%.

The Table Mountain Group (TMG) Aquifer is one of the largest and most important aquifer systems in South Africa and is currently being considered as an alternative source of potable water for the City of Cape Town, a metropolis of over four million people. The TMG aquifer is a fractured rock aquifer hosted primarily in super mature sandstones, quartzites and quartz arenites. The groundwater naturally emanates from numerous springs throughout the cape region. One set of springs were examined to assess the source and residence time of the spring water. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes indicate that the spring water has not been subject to evaporation and in combination with Na/CI ratios implies that recharge to the spring systems is via coastal precipitation. Although rainfall in the Cape is usually modelled on orographic rainfall, delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of some rainfall samples are strongly positive indicating a stratiform component as well. Comparing the spring water delta O-18 and delta H-2 values with that of local rainfall, indicates that the springs are likely derived from continuous bulk recharge over the immediate hinterland to the springs and not through large and/or heavy downpours. Noble gas concentrations, combined with tritium and radiocarbon activities indicate that the residence time of the TMG groundwater in this area is decadal in age with a probable maximum upper limit of similar to 40 years. This residence time is probably a reflection of the slow flow rate through the fractured rock aquifer and hence indicates that the interconnectedness of the fractures is the most important factor controlling groundwater flow. The short residence time of the groundwater suggest that recharge to the springs and the Table Mountain Group Aquifer as a whole is vulnerable to climate change and reductions in regional precipitation. Any plans for large scale abstraction to supplement the City of Cape Town water supply would need to factor this into models of maximum sustainable yield. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents information to support programs that mitigate urban heal islands with solar-reflective surfaces: estimates of the achievable increase in albedo for a variety of surfaces, issues related to the selection of materials and costs and benefits of using them. As an example, we present data for Sacramento, California. In Sacramento, we estimate that 20% of the 96 square mile area is dark roofing and 10% is dark pavement. Based on the change in albedo that is achievable for these surfaces, the overall albedo of Sacramento could be increased by 18%, a change that would produce significant energy savings and increase comfort within the city. Roofing market data indicate which roofing materials should be targeted for incentive programs. In 1995, asphalt shingle was used for over 65% of residential roofing area in the U.S. and 6% of commercial. Built-up roofing was used for about 5% of residential roofing and about 30% of commercial roofing. Single-ply membranes covered about 9% of the residential roofing area and over 30% of the commercial area.

254,WOS:000324723000004,"Many cities are likely to expand in the coming decades and this expansion will probably include low-density neighbourhoods. There is an increasing pressure on cities worldwide to accommodate an increasing population. It is therefore crucial to assess the energy demand and related greenhouse gas emissions implications of such development. This paper uses a representative low-density neighbourhood in Melbourne, Australia, assesses its energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions over 100 years and investigates various scenarios related to house size, transport technology, housing typology and the temporal evolution of parameters. Results show that the energy required to produce and replace building materials and infrastructures constitutes 26.9% of the total energy consumption, while operational and transport requirements represent 39.4% and 33.7% respectively. One of the analysed scenarios reveals that replacing half of the built area of the suburb with apartment buildings reduces the total energy consumption per capita by 19.6%, compared to a typical single storey detached house layout. Regardless of the uncertainty in the data, the main conclusion is that each of the embodied, operational and transport energy demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced in order to improve the overall environmental performance of new urban neighbourhoods.

255,WOS:000394063700014,"Agriculture in the Mediterranean basin is currently contributing to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and in the future is expected to be strongly affected by climate change. Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) via soil organic matter (SOM) improvement is widely regarded as a way to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. Using as a case study the Mediterranean coastal area in Spain, which is regarded as one of the most intensively managed areas in Europe for orchards and horticultural cropping, we analyzed the potential for climate change mitigation of introducing different practides that are expected to increase SOC. We selected both as a single measure and in cOmbination, cover cropping and application to the soil of the available underutilized exogenous organic matter (EOM), treated (e.g. composted or digested) or non-treated. These practices were compared against a baseline scenario that intended to reflect the current practices in the area (e.g. all livestock manure produced in the area is applied to the agricultural soil). We carried out a modelling exercise at the regional scale using the agricultural activity data and current climatic conditions as inputs. Modelling nins were performed coupling a widely used dynamic model of SOC turnover (RothC) with a model to simulate the GHG emissions from EOM processing or storage prior to soil application (SIMSWASTE). Results indicate that the most promising practice, considered as a single measure and with respect to the baseline, was introducing cover crops in woody cropping systems. This practice resulted in an increase of 0.44 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years (range 0.41-0.52 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and led to a total SOC accumulation of about 30 Tg C after 100 years. Amendment of all agricultural land With available underutilized EOM resulted in an increase of up to 0.09 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (range 0.07-0.16 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) as a single measure (Urban waste) and 0.13 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (range 0.11-0.21 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) as a combined measure (urban waste and composted agroindustry by-products), leading to a total SOC accumulation of about 7 Tg C (urban waste) and 10 Tg C (urban waste and composted agroindustry by-products) after 100 years. Manure anaerobic digestion or composting as a single measure did not result in significant SOC changes but, if GHG emissions and savings from manure storage and processing management stages are considered, they could help to reduce about 4.3 (anaerobic digestion) or 1.1 Tg CO(2)eq yr(-1) (composting) in the study area, which represents a significant amount compared with total agricultural emissions in Spain.

256,WOS:000404943800005,"Nutrients and water found in domestic treated wastewater are valuable and can be reutilized in urban agriculture as a potential strategy to provide communities with access to fresh produce. In this paper, this proposition is examined by conducting a field study in the rapidly developing city of Hyderabad, India. Urban agriculture trade-offs in water use, energy use and GHG emissions, nutrient uptake, and crop pathogen quality are evaluated, and irrigation waters of varying qualities (treated wastewater, versus untreated water and groundwater) are compared. The results are counter-intuitive, and illustrate potential synergies and key constraints relating to the food-energy-water-health (FEW-health) nexus in developing cities. First, when the impact of GHG emissions from untreated wastewater diluted in surface streams is compared with the life cycle assessment of wastewater treatment with reuse in agriculture, the treatment-plus-reuse case yields a 33% reduction in life cycle system-wide GHG emissions. Second, despite water cycling benefits in urban agriculture, only < 1% of the nutrients are able to be captured in urban agriculture, limited by the small proportion of effluent divertible to urban agriculture due to land constraints. Thus, water treatment plus reuse in urban farms can enhance GHG mitigation and also directly save groundwater; however, very large amounts of land are needed to extract nutrients from dilute effluents. Third, although energy use for wastewater treatment results in pathogen indicator organism concentrations in irrigation water to be reduced by 99.9% (three orders of magnitude) compared to the untreated case, crop pathogen content was reduced by much less, largely due to environmental contamination and farmer behavior and harvesting practices. The study uncovers key physical, environmental, and behavioral factors that constrain benefits achievable at the FEW-health nexus in urban areas.","Miller-Robbie, L, Ramaswami, A, Amerasinghe, P",1,Hyderabad,IND,10.1088/1748-9326/aa6bfe,SRID=4326;POINT (78.45636 17.38405),3597816,"Wastewater treatment and reuse in urban agriculture: exploring the food, energy, water, and health nexus in Hyderabad, India",2017
257,WOS:000418218300006,"Raising the albedo (solar reflectance) of streets can lower outside air temperature, reduce building energy use, and improve air quality in cities. However, the production and installation of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation treatments with enhanced albedo (""cool"" pavements) may entail more or less energy consumption and carbon emission than that of less-reflective treatments. We developed several case studies in which a cool surface treatment is substituted for a more typical treatment (that is, a cool technology is selected instead of a more typical technology). We then assessed over a 50-year analysis period the changes in primary energy demand (PED, excluding feedstock energy) and global warming potential (GWP, meaning carbon dioxide equivalent) in Los Angeles and Fresno, California. The analysis considers two stages of the pavement life cycle: materials and construction (MAC), comprising material production, transport, and construction; and use, scoped as the influence of pavement albedo on cooling, heating, and lighting energy consumption in buildings. In Los Angeles, substituting a styrene acrylate reflective coating or a chip seal for a slurry seal in routine maintenance, or a bonded concrete overlay on asphalt (BCOA) without supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) for mill-and-fill asphalt concrete in conventional or long-life rehabilitation, induced MAC-stage PED and GWP penalties that substantially exceeded use-stage savings, primarily due to material production. Modified rehabilitation cases in which SCM comprised 21% to 50% of the BCOA's total cementitious content by mass (portland cement+SCM) yielded smaller total (MAC + use) PED and GWP penalties, or even total PED and GWP savings. Trends in Fresno were similar, with some differences in GWP outcomes that result from Fresno's longer heating season. The modified rehabilitation cases using BCOA with high SCM content yielded total GWP savings in each city; all other cases yielded total GWP penalties. The magnitude of the one-time GWP offset offered by global cooling from the increased albedo itself always, and sometimes greatly, exceeded the 50-year total GWP penalty or savings. In Los Angeles, the annual building conditioning (cooling+heating) PED and energy cost savings intensities yielded by cool pavements were each about an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding savings from cool roofs.

259,WOS:000333783900003,"Transforming cities to a lower carbon future is one of the key challenges of contemporary urban governance. Retrofitting the city - or modifying existing urban infrastructures, buildings and daily life to suit different energy sources and different expectations of energy consumption - is essential to this transformation. In urban studies, little focus has yet been applied to the shape and character of urban governance frameworks and mechanisms required to successfully retrofit cities. In this paper we address this lacuna by exploring the logics, practices and dynamics of retrofitting governance in the Australian city. Using a governmentality perspective, the paper identifies the involvements of different scales of government in retrofitting policies and mechanisms and connections between them. Based on a unique survey of carbon reduction initiatives involving government, business and community actors across Australia's capital cities, we outline the types of retrofitting solutions being proposed and enacted. Using a focus on local initiatives from Sydney. Australia's largest city, the paper documents four key techniques through which retrofitting is being governed - self-governing, holistic, facilitative and educative.

We selected Chongqing city, one of the most polluted cities in China, as the case study. The study proposes 5 scenarios that range from baseline to technology promotion through the introduction of carbon tax and subsidy schemes and the implementation of regulations for regional air emissions reduction. We constructed a dynamic evaluation model based on an Input-Output (I/O) analysis for the period 2010-2025. The results show an overall benefit on the quality of the environment and energy conservation efforts. The study demonstrates that the introduction of regulations without promotion of technological innovation will dramatically affect economic growth. The results also show that innovations in the energy sector alone will reduce both air pollutants and energy intensity to a certain extent. In this regard the promotion of innovation in other economic sectors is necessary. Another important finding is the fact that the introduction of regulations will actually curb air emissions and energy consumption.

This extends the usual treatment of energy in urban metabolism studies by (1) providing time series data and (2) attributing upstream primary energy consumption to sectors based on their direct secondary energy usage.

In this paper, we develop a spatial model to determine the potential per parcel for using shallow geothermal energy, for space heating and hot water. The method is based on the space heating and hot water energy demand of each building and the specific heat extraction potential of the subsurface per parcel. With this information, along with the available space per parcel for boreholes, the percentage of the energy demand that could be supplied by geothermal energy is calculated. The potential reduction in CO2 emissions should all possible geothermal energy be utilised, is also calculated. The method is applied to Ludwigsburg, Germany. It was found that CO2 emissions could potentially be reduced by 29.7% if all space heating and hot water requirements were provided by geothermal energy, which would contribute to the sustainability of a city.

263,WOS:000261679000036,"The issue of whether to demolish or refurbish older housing has been debated for over a century. It has been an active policy area since the late 1880s, when the Government first authorised the statutory demolition of insanitary slums. In the 1960s, revulsion at the scale of 'demolition blight' and new building caused a rethink, leading to a major reinvestment in inner city neighbourboods of older housing. In the past 5 years, debate on demolition and new building has been intensified by the Government's Sustainable Communities Plan of 2003, with its proposals for large-scale clearance and building. Environmental arguments about renovating the existing stock have gained increasing prominence as people have sought to defend their communities from demolition. The evidence on whether demolition would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere is unclear and disputed. This paper summarises the evidence and arguments, and attempts to clarify the most realistic, achievable route to major reductions in energy use in homes. The arguments that apply to housing also apply to most other buildings and therefore to the overall built environment, which accounts for half of all carbon emissions. Three main sources of evidence have helped in the development of this paper, but there are many other studies we draw on in the discussion. Firstly, the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University has argued that around three million demolitions are necessary by 2050 if we are to reach the stringent energy reduction targets that will be required in our housing stock [Boardman et al., 2005. 40% House. Environmental Change Institute, Oxford]. Its demolition figure is based on complex modelling that with small modifications can produce very different numbers. Its assessment does not take account of the embodied carbon costs such as volume of new materials, energy use in producing concrete, steel and other structural and infrastructural elements, and other factors affecting the environment Such as land use, infrastructure and area blighting. We discuss these issues in order to clarify the scale of the challenge and the relative value of demolition or renovation. Secondly, the Sustainable Development Commission JSDC, 2006. 'Stock Take': Delivering improvements in existing housing. Sustainable Development Commission, London] argues the urgent need to upgrade the existing stock on the grounds that 70% of all homes that will exist in 2050, even with the ambitious new building programme now announced, are already built. The maximum feasible demolition of two million existing homes by 2050, based on experience to date, suggests that under 10% of the current stock will have been demolished by then. We argue that upgrading this stock to high environmental standards can actually be achieved more cheaply than demolishing it, and with as significant a carbon reduction. Thirdly, the German Federal Housing, Urban and Transport Ministry has announced an ambitious energy reduction programme that will upgrade all pre-1984 homes in Germany by 2020, an estimated 30 million units.' This is based on evidence from several CO(2) reduction programmes since 1996, showing the feasibility of upgrading. An 80% cut in energy use has been achieved, making the performance of the renovated homes at least as good as Germany's current exacting new build standards. The evidence from Germany is more grounded than any that has so far been produced in the UK, as it is based on several thousand examples. The paper also discusses the social and political problems of demolition. There is widespread opposition to large-scale demolition of older stock, mainly pre-1919 terraced homes, which is currently the most 'leaky'. This older property is a prime target for demolition in the Environmental Change Institute's proposals and the Government's plans. The environmental benefits of refurbishment are shown, based on work by the Empty Homes Agency, evidence from English Heritage, the Building Research Establishment and the Prince's Foundation. Work on refurbishment shows that existing homes, often in brick-built terraces, are relatively easy to upgrade and, with careful reinvestment in the existing buildings, can achieve as high environmental efficiency standards as current new build. We consider major social, economic and environmental benefits of refurbishment compared with demolition, including: a reduction in the transport costs, reduced landfill disposal, greater reuse of materials, reuse of infill sites and existing infrastructure, reduced new building on flood plains, local economic development, retention of community infrastructure, neighbourhood renewal and management. We weigh these benefits against the full costs of demolition and rebuilding, involving much higher capital costs, higher material wastage, greater embodied carbon inputs, the polluting impact of particulates, greater use of lorry transport for materials and waste, greater use of aggregates, more noise and disruption. On the social issues of housing need and fuel poverty, we argue that refurbishment and infill building are socially more acceptable, cheaper and create far lower environmental impact, while reducing fuel poverty. The incentive problems associated with renovation and the barriers to delivering it are also discussed. The evidence we have uncovered counters the suggestion that large-scale and accelerated demolition would either help us meet our energy and climate change targets or respond to our social needs. Many arguments remain unclear, but the overall balance of evidence suggests that refurbishment most often makes sense on the basis of time, cost, community impact, prevention of sprawl, reuse of existing infrastructure and protection of existing communities. It can also lead to reduced energy use in buildings in both the short and long term. Many factors will influence what happens in practice, but it seems unlikely under any scenario that the rate of demolition will accelerate far above current levels. Upgrading the existing stock is likely to gain in significance for environmental, social and economic reasons. Adopting policies that aid the retention and upgrading of the existing stock will help develop the necessary skills and technologies, save materials and land, and enhance the integration of existing communities in need of regeneration.

264,WOS:A1996VE38700004,"Transportation planning in general, and planning for Intelligent Transportation Systems (TTS) in particular, are notable both for multiple goals and for multiple constituencies. In response to this policy environment, multicriteria decision analysis has often been utilized to evaluate alternative transportation investments. This approach is extended here to assess stakeholder valuation of broad goals of an ITS planning process, the FAST-TRAC operational field test in Oakland County, a suburban region of metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A. Representatives of stakeholder groups, ranging from emergency response firm employees to city managers to environmental groups, were interviewed. Using a modified Analytical Hierarchy Process, implicit preference weights for transportation planning goals were derived, and inter- and intragroup comparisons made. Overall, collision reduction emerged as a dominant goal accounting for nearly 35% of the overall valuation of all goals. In contrast, travel time reduction and energy/environmental impacts each accounted for about 20% of the total valuation. Stakeholder group affiliation appeared to affect transportation system preferences most strongly with regard to environmental preferences and reduction in commercial travel time; with regard to other goals, individual interests seemed to dominate those of the ostensible stakeholder group. In an environment such as that of ITS, in which policy goals are diverse and potentially conflicting, the methodologies presented here can aid in policy and system design by gauging the relative preferences of strongly interested individuals and groups. While the specific findings presented here are not generalizable to other regions, they underscore the relative importance of a range of ITS goals apart from simple reductions in travel times.

265,WOS:000335923300009,"The continuing growth of the world's urban population has led to an increasing number of cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. The higher emissions of pollutants, coupled to higher population density, makes predictions of air quality in these megacities of particular importance from both a science and a policy perspective. Global climate models are typically run at coarse resolution to enable both the efficient running of long time integrations, and the ability to run multiple future climate scenarios. However, when considering surface ozone concentrations at the local scale, coarse resolution can lead to inaccuracies arising from the highly nonlinear ozone chemistry and the sensitivity of ozone to the distribution of its precursors on smaller scales. In this study, we use UM-UKCA, a global atmospheric chemistry model, coupled to the UK Met Office Unified Model, to investigate the impact of model resolution on tropospheric ozone, ranging from global to local scales. We focus on the model's ability to represent the probability of high ozone concentrations in the summer and low ozone concentrations, associated with polluted megacity environments, in the winter, and how this varies with horizontal resolution. We perform time-slice integrations with two model configurations at typical climate resolution (CR, similar to 150 km) and at a higher resolution (HR, similar to 40 km). The CR configuration leads to overestimation of ozone concentrations on both regional and local scales, while it gives broadly similar results to the HR configuration on the global scale. The HR configuration is found to produce a more realistic diurnal cycle of ozone concentrations and to give a better representation of the probability density function of ozone values in urban areas such as the megacities of London and Paris. We find the observed differences in model behaviour between CR and HR configurations to be largely caused by chemical differences during the winter and meteorological differences during the summer.","Stock, ZS, Russo, MR, Pyle, JA",7,London; Paris,GBR; FRA,10.5194/acp-14-3899-2014,SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853); SRID=4326;POINT (2.3488 48.85341),7556900; 2138551,Representing ozone extremes in European megacities: the importance of resolution in a global chemistry climate model,2014
266,WOS:000382339000027,"Background: Many cities across the world are beginning to shift their mobility solution away from the private cars and towards more environmentally friendly and citizen-focused means. Hamburg, Oslo, Helsinki, and Madrid have recently announced their plans to become (partly) private car free cities. Other cities like Paris, Milan, Chengdu, Masdar, Dublin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Bogota, and Hyderabad have measures that aim at reducing motorized traffic including implementing car free days, investing in cycling infrastructure and pedestrianization, restricting parking spaces and considerable increases in public transport provision. Such plans and measures are particularly implemented with the declared aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These reductions are also likely to benefit public health. Aims: We aimed to describe the plans for private car free cities and its likely effects on public health. Methods: We reviewed the grey and scientific literature on plans for private car free cities, restricted car use, related exposures and health. Results: An increasing number of cities are planning to become (partly) private car free. They mainly focus on the reduction of private car use in city centers. The likely effects of such policies are significant reductions in traffic related air pollution, noise, and temperature in city centers. For example, up to a 40% reduction in NO2 levels has been reported on car free days. These reductions are likely to lead to a reduction in premature mortality and morbidity. Furthermore the reduction in the number of cars, and therefore a reduction in the need for parking places and road space, provides opportunities to increase green space and green networks in cities, which in turn can lead to many beneficial health effects. All these measures are likely to lead to higher levels of active mobility and physical activity which may improve public health the most and also provide more opportunities for people to interact with each other in public space. Furthermore, such initiatives, if undertaken at a sufficiently large scale can result in positive distal effects and climate change mitigation through CO2 reductions. The potential negative effects which may arise due to motorized traffic detouring around car free zone into their destinations also need further evaluation and the areas in which car free zones are introduced need to be given sufficient attention so as not to become an additional way to exacerbate socioeconomic divides. The extent and magnitude of all the above effects is still unclear and needs further research, including full chain health impact assessment modeling to quantify the potential health benefits of such schemes, and exposure and epidemiological studies to measure any changes when such interventions take place. Conclusions: The introduction of private car free cities is likely to have direct and indirect health benefits, but the exact magnitude and potential conflicting effects are as yet unclear.

267,WOS:000375170600022,"Current modal share in Indian cities is in favor of non-motorized transport (NMT) and public transport (PT), however historical trends shows decline in its use. Existing NMT and PT infrastructure in Indian cities is of poor quality resulting in increasing risk from road traffic crashes to these users. It is therefore likely that the current NMT and PT users will shift to personal motorized vehicles (PMV) as and when they can afford it. Share of NMT and PT users can be retained and possibly increased if safe and convenient facilities for them are created. This shall also have impact on reducing environment impacts of transport system. We have studied travel behavior of three medium size cities - Udaipur, Rajkot and Vishakhapatnam. Later the impact of improving built environment and infrastructure on travel mode shares, fuel consumption, emission levels and traffic safety in Rajkot and Vishakhapatnam are analyzed. For the purpose three scenarios are developed - improving only NMT infrastructure, improving only bus infrastructure and improving both NMT and bus infrastructure. The study shows the strong role of NMT infrastructure in both cities despite geographical dissimilarities. The scenario analysis shows maximum reduction in CO2 emissions is achieved when both PT and NMT infrastructure are improved. Improvementin safety indicator is highest in this scenario. Improving only PT infrastructure may have marginal effect on overall reduction of CO2 emissions and adverse effects on traffic safety. NMT infrastructure is crucial for maintaining the travel mode shares in favor of PT and NMT in future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The expectation is that LED street lighting technology will not only provide more efficient light distribution and increased uniformity but will also save energy and reduce maintenance costs. Seattle City Light (SCL), Washington, has a street lighting system of nearly 84,000 street and area lights that predominantly use HPS light sources. Because of the potential benefits of installing LED luminaires as replacements for these lights, SCL launched the LED Streetlight Application Assessment Project pilot study to evaluate LED luminaires for photometric performance, energy efficiency, economic performance, and other impacts on the SCL streetlight system. The project findings will be used by SCL to create a strategy for the installation of LED streetlights to develop an energy-efficient lighting system. The major elements of this project included LED luminaire selection, simulated photometric performance evaluation of selected LED products, field photometric performance evaluation at selected test sites, and economic performance evaluation in comparison with HPS luminaires.

A 12-week dietary intervention study was carried out to test the effectiveness of an energy-restricted, low-fat, sugar-containing diet on weight loss in sedentary overweight men. The study also aimed to assess eating behaviour, to measure change in attitude towards sugar-containing foods and to measure the impact of the study on perceived quality of life. Subjects were recruited from three UK cities; Edinburgh, Birmingham and London. Seventy-six men, aged between 25 and 60 years, completed the study. Baseline diets were assessed by a 7-day diet diary. Compliance to the subsequent dietary advice was measured on four occasions post intervention, by 4-day diaries. Measures of body weight status were also monitored. Eating behaviour, attitudes towards sugar-containing foods and quality of life were assessed by questionnaire. Significant reductions in body weight (5.2%), body fat (11.2%) and waist: hip ratio (3%) were observed following reported dietary changes that included a reduction in reported energy intake of 3.2 MJ/day (770 kcal/day), a reduction in the percent energy from fat (from 38.1% to 26.2%), an increase in the percent energy from total carbohydrate (from 44.4% to 54%) and from protein ( from 17.3% to 20.6%). Subjects scored relatively highly for dietary restraint and emotional eating, and were strongly influenced by external eating cues. On completion of the 12-week study, subjects had a more positive attitude towards sugar-containing foods and perceived an improved quality of life.

271,WOS:000407554500011,"In this paper, passive cooling strategies have been investigated to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing cooling thermal loads and air conditioning energy consumption for residential buildings in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Specifically, three passive cooling techniques have been evaluated including natural ventilation, downdraft evaporative cooling, and earth tube cooling. These passive cooling systems are applied to a prototypical KSA residential villa model with an improved building envelope. The analysis has been carried using detailed simulation tool for several cities representing different climate conditions throughout KSA. The impact of the passive cooling systems is evaluated on both energy consumption and electrical peak demand for residential villas with and without improved building envelope for five cities, representatives of various climate conditions in KSA. It is found that both natural ventilation and evaporative cooling provide a significant reduction in cooling energy use and electrical peak demand for the prototypical villa located in dry KSA climates such as that of Riyadh and Tabuk. Natural ventilation alone has reduced the cooling energy end-use by 22%, while the evaporative cooling system has resulted in 64% savings in cooling energy end-use. Moreover, the natural ventilation is found to have a high potential in all KSA climates, while evaporative cooling can be suitable only in hot and dry climates such as Riyadh and Tabuk.

Certainly all entities need to adapt Energy Conservation and Management Strategies. This is due to high monthly consumption of energy; energy bills of Saudi telecom exchange buildings are a good example. To improve energy savings of such installations, it is necessary to either provide well designed new buildings, or enhance existing buildings with more energy saving strategy practices. This paper investigates the impact of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system characteristics, designed spaces of buildings, operational strategies, the impact of envelope thermal characteristics and energy conservation measures. These measures are classified under three types; i.e. zero-investment, low-investment and high-investment energy conservation measures. The study shows that the energy conservation measures (ECMs) pertaining to the HVAC system characteristics and operation represent the highest potential for energy reduction. Attention should be given to window thermal and solar radiation characteristics, when large window areas are used. The type of glazing system needs to be carefully considered in the early design phase of future buildings. The HVAC set points to provide optimal operation of telecom devices in the exchange center.

273,WOS:000304879800009,"Source-separated collection of food waste has been reported to reduce the amount of household waste in several cities including Kyoto, Japan. Food waste can be reduced by various activities including preventing edible food loss, draining moisture, and home composting. These activities have different potentials for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Therefore, we conducted a life-cycle inventory analysis of household waste management scenarios for Kyoto with a special emphasis on food waste reduction activities. The primary functional unit of our study was ""annual management of household combustible waste in Kyoto, Japan."" Although some life-cycle assessment scenarios included food waste reduction measures, all of the scenarios had an identical secondary functional unit, ""annual food ingestion (mass and composition) by the residents of Kyoto, Japan."" We analyzed a typical incineration scenario (Inc) and two anaerobic digestion (dry thermophilic facilities) scenarios involving either source-separated collection (SepBio) or nonseparated collection followed by mechanical sorting (MecBio). We assumed that the biogas from anaerobic digestion was used for power generation. In addition, to evaluate the effects of waste reduction combined with separate collection, three food waste reduction cases were considered in the SepBio scenario: (1) preventing loss of edible food (PrevLoss); (2) draining moisture contents (ReducDrain); and (3) home composting (ReducHcom). In these three cases, we assumed that the household waste was reduced by 5%. The GHG emissions from the Inc, MecBio, and SepBio scenarios were 123.3, 119.5, and 118.6 Gg CO2-eq/year, respectively. Compared with the SepBio scenario without food waste reduction, the PrevLoss and ReducDrain cases reduced the GHG emissions by 17.1 and 0.5 Gg CO2-eq/year. In contrast, the ReducHcom case increased the GHG emissions by 2.1 Gg CO2-eq/year. This is because the biogas power production decreased due to the reduction in food waste, while the electricity consumption increased in response to home composting. Sensitivity analyses revealed that a reduction of only 1% of the household waste by food loss prevention has the same GHG reduction effect as a 31-point increase (from 50% to 81%) in the food waste separation rate. We found that prevention of food losses enhanced by separate collection led to a significant reduction in GHG emissions. These findings will be useful in future studies designed to develop strategies for further reductions in GHG emissions.","Matsuda, T, Yano, J, Hirai, Y, Sakai, S",17,Kyoto,JPN,10.1007/s11367-012-0400-4,SRID=4326;POINT (135.75385 35.02107),1459640,"Life-cycle greenhouse gas inventory analysis of household waste management and food waste reduction activities in Kyoto, Japan",2012

Building on ideas of policy experimentation at the nexus of institutional and transition theories, this paper assesses six climate change adaptation experiments across the cities of Surat, Indore and Bhubaneswar in India to uncover the politics behind how experiments are conceived of, implemented, and supported in light of local development needs. Through employing both embedded and cross-case comparative methods, I argue that policy experiments are often framed around achieving tangible urban economic benefits and maximizing specific project complementarities, which allow emerging adaptation priorities access to established policy directives and funding streams. However, I conclude that despite being arenas for testing new ideas, quantifying climate and development co-benefits, and engaging private and civil society actors, adaptation policy experiments must be coherent with urban political economic contexts in order for them to affect sustained, equitable and transformative programmatic change.

275,WOS:000392789000062,"Energy demand for urban water supply is emerging as a significant issue. This work undertakes a multi city time-series analysis of the direct energy use for urban water supply. It quantifies the energy use and intensity for water supply in 30 cities (total population of over 170 million) and illustrates their performance with a new time-based water-energy profiling approach. Per capita energy use for water provision ranged from 10 kWh/p/a (Melbourne in 2015) to 372 kWh/p/a (San Diego in 2015). Raw water pumping and product water distribution dominate the energy use of most of these systems. For 17 cities with available time-series data (between 2000 and 2015), a general trend in reduction of per capita energy use for water provision is observed (11%-45% reduction). The reduction is likely to be a result of improved water efficiency in most of the cities. Potential influencing factors including climate, topography, operational efficiency and water use patterns are explored to understand why energy use for water provision differs across the cities, and in some cities changes substantially over time. The key insights from this multi-city analysis are that i) some cities may be considered as benchmarks for insight into management of energy use for water provision by better utilising local topography, capitalising on climate events, improving energy efficiency of supply systems, managing non-revenue water and improving residential water efficiency; ii) energy associated with non-revenue water is found to be very substantial in multiple cities studied and represents a significant energy saving potential (i.e. a population-weighted average of 16 kWh/p/a, 25% of the average energy use for water provision); and iii) three Australian cities which encountered a decade-long drought demonstrated the beneficial role of demand-side measures in reducing the negative energy consequences of system augmentations with seawater desalination and inter-basin water transfers.

Here the municipality energy advisors and the national register for energy performance certificates can facilitate the mitigation of energy use in the building stock. So far few studies have focused on the practical road map to the national target of energy use on the city/district level and to the communication aspects with stakeholders in the creation of energy city models. In this paper a city energy model is developed based on the requests and need for visualization from a group of energy advisors. Six different scenarios are studied in order to analyze the possibility of reaching the energy targets specified by the government in the town of Kiruna. The results show that: (1) it is possible to automatically create city energy models using extract, transform and load tools based on spatial and non-spatial data from national registers and databases; (2) city energy models improve the understanding of energy use in buildings and can therefore be a valuable tool for energy advisors, real estate companies and urban planners.

Based on a preliminary decomposition model, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Ward's hierarchical clustering, an intensity allocation method is proposed. First, the preliminary regional decomposition scheme is presented via the preliminary decomposition model. Then, a multi-criteria evaluation system consisting of four layers and covering 13 evaluation indicators is developed via the AHP method, and the evaluation results are analyzed via the cluster method to further improve the preliminary scheme. As decision makers may have different preferences when allocating the reduction burden, we allocate different weights to the indicators and analyze the results using a sensitivity analysis.

One of the most efficient and effective ways to ease energy shortage is to sufficiently reduce energy intensity. In the extant literature on the influential factors of China's energy intensity, the regional imbalance and spatial spillover effects were basically ignored, which may yield to biased and unreasonable results. As a result, in this paper, the driving forces of China's provincial energy intensity were for the first time investigated by combining the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-Malmquist and spatial panel approaches for the period between 2000 and 2014. The results indicate that technological progress plays a dominant role in decreasing China's overall energy intensity. In both the Eastern and Central regions, the technological progress and its components can decrease energy intensity, while this effect doesnot significantly exist in the Western region. Rapid industrialization should be responsible for China's currently high energy intensity, while energy price hiking is conducive to the decrease in energy intensity.

279,WOS:000423002200019,"Urban activities are the primary source of carbon emissions. With the accelerating development of urbanization, cities are now facing the dual pressures of maintaining economic growth and reducing carbon emissions, and mega-cities like Shanghai play a crucial role in emission reduction. An integrated system dynamic model (including eight sub-models, which are socio-economic; primary, secondary, and tertiary industry; residential; transportation; waste disposal; and electricity models) is developed using the Vensim platform for evaluating carbon emission trends in Shanghai during 1991-2015, from the perspective of an urban planning system. The results show a general increasing trend in total carbon emissions that reached 245.78 million tons CO2-equivalent (Mt CO2-eq) in 2015, which is nearly three times as much as that in 1991. This study also shows that the electric power sector is the main contributor to carbon emissions. Five emission-reduction scenarios were generated by inputting values of planning indicators from the National Economy and Social Development Plan (NESDP) that have direct and indirect impacts on carbon emissions. According to the results of this analysis, the lowest level of carbon emissions is from a scenario with slower socio-economic development and reinforced electrical and industrial energy efficiency programs (Scenario IV), which demonstrates that the appropriate control of energy consumption from secondary industry (especially the electricity sector) will play a positive role in carbon emission mitigation in Shanghai. Outcomes of this study can provide essential information for policy-makers to advance Shanghai's future low-carbon development.

282,WOS:000368206800009,"Municipal heating by coal contributes considerably to the haze pollution in Chinese cities during cold period, e.g., Beijing 53%. It is widely considered that, as a supplement of natural gas, the use of coal-based synthetic natural gas (SNG) to replace coal for municipal heating is conductive to mitigate the haze pollution in metropolitan areas. Would it still be a good alternative if the whole life cycle of SNG were taken into consideration? In this study, SNG as an alternative for municipal heating is analyzed in comparison with coal. To target cleaner production, life cycle assessment methodology is used to analyze SNG contribution to haze pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, as well as energy consumption. Compared to coal heating route, SNG heating route could reduce 44% of the haze pollutants emissions from life. cycle perspective and up to 98% of the emissions in urban area. Thus, if municipal heating were entirely supplied by natural gas and SNG, there would be 52% less haze pollutants emissions in winter of Beijing. However, this ""good"" performance is at the cost of transferring haze pollutants emissions from urban areas to SNG-producing regions. It is also at the cost of consuming 90% more coal and emitting 65% more GHGs than the coal heating route from life cycle point of view. To tackle the problems of haze pollutants transfer and the increase of GHGs emissions, the paper suggests implementing ecological compensation and carbon tax policies in the coal-based SNG industry.

In this study, the factors that should be considered to achieve net GHG reductions from incineration were analysed from a life cycle perspective. These considerations were then applied to the energy supply requirements in seven Japanese metropolises. Firstly, the carbon footprints of approximately 1500 incineration plants in Japan were calculated. Then, the incineration plants with negative carbon footprint values were classified as net GHG reducers.

Yet for cities in low-income countries, the value of these urban landscapes in climate change response strategies is often disregarded and remains largely unexploited and unaccounted for. This paper discusses the potential role of urban green landscapes as a ""soft engineering"" climate change response strategy, and calls for the pursuance of management practices that preserve and promote the use of these urban spaces. It does so by combining theoretical arguments with an empirical example based on an innovative and novel approach to landscape rehabilitation, the Lafarge Ecosystems Programme, in the coastal city of Mombasa, Kenya. The paper finds that a well-managed system of green landscapes in resource-poor urban areas can generate net social benefits under a range of future scenarios. It further finds that climate change adaptation and mitigation responses can be initiated by a range of stakeholders operating at all scales.","Kithiia, J, Lyth, A",23,Mombasa,KEN,10.1177/0956247810396054,SRID=4326;POINT (39.66359 -4.05466),799668,Urban wildscapes and green spaces in Mombasa and their potential contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation,2011

Understanding the dynamics of local energy use is an important precondition of understanding how to remedy this situation. This paper builds a model to estimate the building sector energy end-use intensity (kwh/m(2) floor area) for space heating, domestic hot water, electricity for space cooling and electricity for non-space cooling applications in New York City. The model assumes that such end use is primarily dependent on building function, whether residential, educational or office for example, and not on construction type or the age of the building. The modeled intensities are calibrated using ZIP code level electricity and fuel use data reported by the New York City Mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability. The end-use ratios were derived from the Residential and Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey's Public Use Microdata. The results provide the ability to estimate the end-use energy consumption of each tax lot in New York City. The resulting spatially explicit energy consumption can be a valuable tool for determining cost-effectiveness and policies for implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.

Drawing on literature from policy mobilities and resource and energy governance, this paper analyzes policymaking processes that resulted in a December 2013 ordinance in Dallas, Texas, which established a 1500 foot (457.2 meter) setback between gas wells and residences, making drilling (with hydraulic fracturing) nearly impossible. Dallas was not the first city in the region to adopt an oil and gas drilling ordinance; indeed, many regulatory provisions were copied from other regional cities. This paper explains policy mobility in the Dallas policymaking process in terms of anti-political practices and hydrocarbon institutions that, overall, determine neoliberal hydrocarbon governance. City governments cede some of the political process to gas drilling task forces that work to render setbacks technical. Legal classification of subsurface hydrocarbons as the mineral estate creates a legal gray area that confounds municipal regulatory authority and gives discursive power to mineral owners to threaten municipal officials with lawsuits. Both of these anti-political strategies encouraged selective copying and morphing of other policy provisions by the Dallas city government.

Here we reveal two hidden benefits of EVs for addressing climate change to support the imperative acceleration of replacing CVs with EVs. As EVs emit much less heat than CVs within the same mileage, the replacement can mitigate urban heat island effect (UHIE) to reduce the energy consumption of air conditioners, benefitting local and global climates. To demonstrate these effects brought by the replacement of CVs by EVs, we take Beijing, China, as an example. EVs emit only 19.8% of the total heat emitted by CVs per mile. The replacement of CVs by EVs in 2012 could have mitigated the summer heat island intensity (HII) by about 0.946 degrees C, reduced the amount of electricity consumed daily by air conditioners in buildings by 14.44 million kilowatt-hours (kWh), and reduced daily CO2 emissions by 10,686 tonnes.","Li, CB, Cao, YJ, Zhang, M, Wang, JH, Liu, JG, Shi, HQ, Geng, YH",1,Beijing,CHN,10.1038/srep09213,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,Hidden Benefits of Electric Vehicles for Addressing Climate Change,2015

291,WOS:000350087900024,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are an important component of the greenhouse gas (GHG) budget for urban turfgrasses. A biogeochemical model DNDC successfully captured the magnitudes and patterns of N2O emissions observed at an urban turfgrass system at the Richland Creek Watershed in Nashville, TN. The model was then used to study the long-term (i.e. 75 years) impacts of lawn management practice (LMP) on soil organic carbon sequestration rate (dSOC), soil N2O emissions, and net Global Warming Potentials (net GWPs). The model simulated N2O emissions and net GWP from the three management intensity levels over 75 years ranged from 0.75 to 3.57 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 697 to 2443 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, which suggested that turfgrasses act as a net carbon emitter. Reduction of fertilization is most effective to mitigate the global warming potentials of turfgrasses. Compared to the baseline scenario, halving fertilization rate and clipping recycle as an alternative to synthetic fertilizer can reduce net GWPs by 17% and 12%, respectively. In addition, reducing irrigation and mowing are also effective in lowering net GWPs. The minimum-maintenance LMP without irrigation and fertilization can reduce annual N2O emissions and net GWPs by approximately 53% and 70%, respectively, with the price of gradual depletion of soil organic carbon, when compared to the intensive-maintenance LMP. A lawn age-dependent best management practice is recommended: a high dose fertilizer input at the initial stage of lawn establishment to enhance SOC sequestration, followed by decreasing fertilization rate when the lawn ages to minimize N2O emissions. A minimum-maintained LMP with clipping recycling, and minimum irrigation and mowing, is recommended to mitigate global warming effects from urban turfgrass systems. Among all practices, clipping recycle may be a relatively malleable behavior and, therefore, a good target for interventions seeking to reduce the environmental impacts of lawn management through public education. Our results suggest that a long-term or a chronosequence study of turfgrasses with varying ages is warranted to capture the complete dynamics of contribution of turfgrasses to global warming.

The groundwater age at 40 m depth in the aquifer underlying the river was 1.3 +/- 0.8 years, determined by tritium-helium dating. This corresponds to a vertical flow rate into the aquifer of 19 m/year. Electrical conductivity and partial pressure of CO2 (P-CO2) indicate that water recharged from the river is present in both the sandy Holocene and gravelly Pleistocene aquifers and is also abstracted by the pumping station. Infiltrating river water becomes anoxic in the uppermost aquifer due to the oxidation of dissolved organic carbon. Further downward, sedimentary carbon oxidation causes the reduction of As-containing Fe-oxides. Because the release of arsenic by reduction of Fe-oxides is controlled by the reaction rate, arsenic entering the solution becomes highly diluted in the high water flux and contributes little to the groundwater arsenic concentration. Instead, the As concentration in the groundwater of up to 1 mu M is due to equilibrium-controlled desorption of arsenic, adsorbed to the sediment before river water started to infiltrate due to municipal pumping.

However, there are many arguments about the definition of 'low carbon' and the framework that low-carbon development should follow. Low-carbon development in an economically least developed region such as Guangyuan would provide evidence and contribute to the discussion.

The results have demonstrated that a 'win-win' solution can be reached-keeping rapid economic growth while reducing CO2 emissions, however, only by addressing the 'correct' determining factors.

Drawing upon a case study of Leicester this paper argues that the ability of local authorities to deliver significant energy savings within this landscape is questionable, albeit with other additional benefits being realised (e. g. job creation, community engagement). It examines existing domestic energy demand and multiple deprivation data for Leicester and neighbouring cities and combines this with a qualitative description of the transition process. The paper identifies the need for a more systematic analysis of how national energy policy translates to the local level and concludes that it is problematic even for a leading, pro-active and innovative local authority to have a statistically meaningful energy policy. Even where energy policies are favourable, carbon reduction is less easy to realise than other e more local -co-benefits and that in the light of significant financial and co-ordination constraints more attention needs to be given to how local communities can be more effectively supported in their desire to meet (or exceed) national targets.

296,WOS:000423001900027,"Suburbs have naturally become a focal point of carbon mitigation for cities undergoing rapid suburbanization. This has created a debate over which urban form can more effectively lead to lower household carbon footprints (CF). Previous suburban-scale studies using economic input-output life cycle assessment with national average carbon intensities have demonstrated the mitigation potentials in households via urban planning. However, there is a need for suburban-scale multiregional input-output (MRIO) tables to model suburb-specific carbon intensities and thus to account for the heterogeneity of both production and consumption in different suburbs. This study explores the case of Sydney, Australia, and its many suburbs. The CF of households is broken down into 111 sectors and 248 spatial divisions of Greater Sydney by employing a suburban-scale MRIO model. The impact of domestic and overseas migration on household CFs is modelled during 2009-2010, and the CFs are allocated to different ethnic groups. The results suggest that residents in the densely populated city core have a comparable CF to residents living in outer city suburbs, thus contradicting previous studies supporting the notion that densely populated inner-city areas yield relatively lower CFs. The rapid growth of population increases household CFs in inner western suburbs. According to the study findings, the ongoing Sydney metropolitan development plan may therefore not be sufficient to provide a sustainable carbon emissions reduction strategy, if suburb density is increased without any constraints on resident consumption patterns. Urban planners need to consider policies to direct the investment brought by immigration towards a lower-carbon economy and infrastructure and also may take advantage of the sharing economy to change consumption behaviour.

Urban environments exhibit several factors affecting plant growth and function, including high temperatures (particularly at night), CO2 concentrations and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We investigated the effects of urban environments on growth in Quercus rubra L. seedlings. We grew seedlings from acorns for one season at four sites along an urban-rural transect from Central Park in New York City to the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York (difference in average maximum temperatures of 2.4 degrees C; difference in minimum temperatures of 4.6 degrees C). In addition, we grew Q. rubra seedlings in growth cabinets (GCs) mimicking the seasonal differential between the city and rural sites (based on a 5-year average). In the field experiment, we found an eightfold increase in biomass in urban-grown seedlings relative to those grown at rural sites. This difference was primarily related to changes in growth allocation. Urban-grown seedlings and seedlings grown at urban temperatures in the GCs exhibited a lower root: shoot ratio (urban similar to 0.8, rural/remote similar to 1.5), reducing below-ground carbon costs associated with construction and maintenance. These urban seedlings instead allocated more growth to leaves than did rural-grown seedlings, resulting in 10-fold greater photosynthetic area but no difference in photosynthetic capacity of foliage per unit area. Seedlings grown at urban temperatures in both the field and GC experiments had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations per unit area than those grown at cooler temperatures (increases of 23% in field, 32% in GC). Lastly, we measured threefold greater C-13 enrichment of respired CO2 (relative to substrate) in urban-grown leaves than at other sites, which may suggest greater allocation of respiratory function to growth over maintenance. It also shows that lack of differences in total R flux in response to environmental conditions may mask dramatic shifts in respiratory functioning. Overall, our findings indicating greater seedling growth and establishment at a critical regeneration phase of forest development may have important implications for the ecology of urban forests as well as the predicted growth of the terrestrial biosphere in temperate regions in response to climate change.","Searle, SY, Turnbull, MH, Boelman, NT, Schuster, WSF, Yakir, D, Griffin, KL",25,New York City,USA,10.1093/treephys/tps027,SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),8175133,Urban environment of New York City promotes growth in northern red oak seedlings,2012
299,WOS:000311600500011,"Objective: Estimate the health risks and benefits of mode shifts from car to cycling and public transport in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. Methods: We conducted a health impact assessment (HIA), creating 8 different scenarios on the replacement of short and long car trips, by public transport or/and bike. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality and change in life expectancy related to two different assessments: A) the exposure of travellers to physical activity, air pollution to particulate matter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5), and road traffic fatality; and B) the exposure of general population to PM2.5, modelling by Barcelona Air-Dispersion Model. The secondary outcome was a change in emissions of carbon dioxide. Results: The annual health impact of a shift of 40% of the car trips, starting and ending in Barcelona City, to cycling (n = 141,690) would be for the travellers who shift modes 1.15 additional deaths from air pollution, 0.17 additional deaths from road traffic fatality and 67.46 deaths avoided from physical activity resulting in a total of 6612 deaths avoided. Fewer deaths would be avoided annually if half of the replaced trips were shifted to public transport (43.76 deaths). The annual health impact in the Barcelona City general population (n=1.630,494) of the 40% reduction in car trips would be 10.03 deaths avoided due to the reduction of 0.64% in exposure to PM2.5. The deaths (including travellers and general population) avoided in Barcelona City therefore would be 76.15 annually. Further health benefits would be obtained with a shift of 40% of the car trips from the Greater Barcelona Metropolitan which either start or end in Barcelona City to public transport (40.15 deaths avoided) or public transport and cycling (98.50 deaths avoided). The carbon dioxide reduction for shifting from car to other modes of transport (bike and public transport) in Barcelona metropolitan area was estimated to be 203251 t/CO2 emissions per year. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce car use and increase cycling and the use of public transport in metropolitan areas, like Barcelona, can produce health benefits for travellers and for the general population of the city. Also these interventions help to reduce green house gas emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

301,WOS:000389320800018,"Energy conservation in residential and commercial buildings is considered a key challenge and opportunity for low-carbon urban development. In cities worldwide, energy conservation initiatives have been realized that demonstrate the social, financial, and environmental benefits that energy conservation can generate. However, in order to accomplish international goals pertaining to climate mitigation, these initiatives need to go to scale and reach a greater and broader audience. To accelerate the scaling-up of such initiatives, an in-depth understanding of barriers hampering this process and local strategies that can be applied to address these barriers is required. While scholars and practitioners underline the importance of local solutions to the global problem of climate change, little is known about strategies that can be applied at the local level to overcome barriers. This paper has three general findings that can make a valuable contribution to theory and practice on urban climate governance. First, it sketches the context-specificity of barriers to scaling-up energy conservation initiatives and reflects on similarities and differences in barriers to energy conservation in residential and commercial building stocks in two European cities: Utrecht and Valencia. Second, this paper presents several local strategies that can be applied to overcome barriers, thereby improving our understanding of the relation between barriers and solutions.

303,WOS:000376413600004,"This paper updates the SCVI (Socio-Climatic Vulnerability Index) maps developed by Torres et al. (2012) for Brazil, by using the new Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) projections and more recent 2010 social indicators data. The updated maps differ significantly from their earlier versions in two main ways. First, they show that heavily populated metropolitan areas - namely Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Salvador, Manaus, Rio de Janeiro and So Paulo - and a large swath of land across the states of So Paulo, Minas Gerais and Bahia now have the highest SCVI values, that is, their populations are the most vulnerable to climate change in the country. Second, SCVI values for Northeast Brazil are considerably lower compared to the previous index version. An analysis of the causes of such difference reveals that changes in climate projections between CMIP3 and CMIP5 are responsible for most of the change between the different SCVI values and spatial distribution, while changes in social indicators have less influence, despite recent countrywide improvements in social indicators as a result of aggressive anti-poverty programs. These results raise the hypothesis that social reform alone may not be enough to decrease people's vulnerability to future climatic changes. Whereas the coarse spatial resolution and relatively simplistic formulation of the SCVI may limit how useful these maps are at informing decision-making at the local level, they can provide a valuable input for large-scale policies on climate change adaptation such as those of the Brazilian National Policy on Climate Change Adaptation.","Darela, JP, Lapola, DM, Torres, RR, Lemos, MC",2,Toritama; Salvador; Belo Horizonte; Manaus,BRA; BRA; BRA; BRA,10.1007/s10584-016-1635-z,SRID=4326;POINT (-36.05667 -8.00667); SRID=4326;POINT (-38.51083 -12.97111); SRID=4326;POINT (-43.93778 -19.92083); SRID=4326;POINT (-60.025 -3.10194),23940; 2711840; 2373224; 1598210,Socio-climatic hotspots in Brazil: how do changes driven by the new set of IPCC climatic projections affect their relevance for policy?,2016
304,WOS:000380141500035,"Irrigated agriculture is an important economic factor in the rural parts of the metropolitan area of Hamburg. It is commonly expected that climate change will reduce the groundwater quantities available for field irrigation. Against this background, the ratio of irrigation need and groundwater recharge (IGR-ratio) is suggested as an indicator to assess climate change impacts on the vulnerability of groundwater resources towards overexploitation by agricultural irrigation. The IGR-ratio has been assessed based on the distributed water balance model mGROWA, i.e. under consideration of the simulated groundwater recharge levels and the field crop-specific irrigation need of the commonly cultivated field crops. The spatial IGR-ratio distribution determined for the observed reference period 1971-2000 has shown that the delineated vulnerable areas coincide with the regions for which high irrigation quantities have been documented at present. Additionally, the IGR-ratio depicts the areas in which irrigation is currently still negligible, but in which the introduction of irrigation into agricultural practice would lead to an immediate overexploitation of the sustainably available groundwater budget. The possible impact of future climate on IGR-ratios was determined by using a model chain of mGROWA and the regional climate models REMO and WET-TREG2010. The related ensemble simulations did not provide a uniform tendency of possible future IGR-ratio changes. Whereas the mGROWA-WETTREG2010 realisations projected a very high increase in the IGR-ratios, the mGROWA-REMO realisations did not show a pronounced trend of increasing IGR-ratios. Therefore, considerable uncertainties remain regarding the future bandwidth of IGR-ratio changes.","Herrmann, F, Kunkel, R, Ostermann, U, Vereecken, H, Wendland, F",2,Hamburg,DEU,10.1007/s12665-016-5904-y,SRID=4326;POINT (10.01534 53.57532),1739117,Projected impact of climate change on irrigation needs and groundwater resources in the metropolitan area of Hamburg (Germany),2016

Given its large population size, economic importance, and projected population growth, the Ontario provincial government recognized the need to plan for the growth of jobs and people to avoid the adverse effects of urban sprawl, traffic gridlock, and the loss of farmland and natural areas. Ontario's 2005 Greenbelt Plan and 2006 Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Places to Grow) established the legislative framework to guide development and population growth within southern Ontario. While directing development and promoting population growth in specified areas, an unintended consequence of these legislative plans may, however, be increased commuting distance as workers commute from beyond the Greenbelt into the employment dense areas inside the Greenbelt. This article focuses upon the intersection between migration and commuting distance in southern Ontario's GGH region, within the context of ongoing population growth, and Greenbelt and Places to Grow legislation. Results indicate that migrants moving beyond the Greenbelt have generally longer commute distances, with implications for the sustainability of communities and government policies aimed at reducing the carbon footprint.","Newbold, KB, Scott, D",2,Ontario,USA,10.1111/j.1541-0064.2013.12044.x,SRID=4326;POINT (-117.65089 34.06334),171214,"Migration, commuting distance, and urban sustainability in Ontario's Greater Golden Horseshoe: Implications of the Greenbelt and Places to Grow legislation",2013

In contrast to other forms of public transport, there is no waiting, stopping, or transferring. In many situations, the new system can offer better transport than available by other means. ULTra has been designed to demanding sustainability requirements. Typically, ULTra reduces energy use and emissions by a factor of three compared with existing transport systems and also complements those systems. By providing a network link to major rail and bus stations, ULTra can make current transport services more attractive to passengers. The new system is also well suited for other major activity centers such as airports. In essence, ULTra replaces the old mass transit paradigm for transport with a new paradigm based on just-in-time transit. ULTra is now undergoing engineering development funded by the U.K. Department for Transport on a 1-km test track in Cardiff, Wales. The Cardiff County Council has received funding commitments by the National Assembly of Wales that could lead to system implementation by 2005.

307,WOS:000295753000093,"Industries in Durban, South Africa, are a major source of air pollutant emissions and large users of fossil fuel based energy. Durban's energy strategy prioritises energy efficiency at industries as a key action, whilst industries are also the focus of the city's air quality management plan (AQMP). In this paper, measures that have been introduced in industries in Durban to effect air quality improvements and reduce energy consumption are examined in terms of their respective impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. It was found that co-benefits for GHG mitigation were achieved when petroleum refineries switched from using heavy fuel oil to refinery gas and methane rich gas. Within other industries, co-benefits for air quality stemmed from reducing fossil fuel energy consumption and the improved efficiency of combustion systems. Air quality and energy policies in the city are being executed independently, without consideration of the trade-offs or synergies of the interventions being implemented. Recommendations are made for authorities and industries to consider the co-benefits for GHG mitigation in their AQMPs and where these are not possible to consider offsetting the increased GHG emissions through improved alignment with energy strategies.

308,WOS:000356200700009,"Evaluating transport policy for cities in developing countries is often constrained by data availability that limits the use of conventional appraisal models. Here, we present a new 'bottom-up' methodology to estimate transport CO2 emission from daily urban passenger travel for Beijing, a megacity with relatively sparse data on travel behaviour. A spatial microsimulation, based on an activity diary survey and two sample population censuses, is used to simulate, for Beijing's urban districts, a realistic synthetic population, and their daily travel and CO2 emission over 2000-2010. This approach provides greater insight into the spatial variability of transport CO2 emission than has previously been possible for Beijing, and further, enables an examination of the role of socio-demographics, urban form and transport developments in contributing to emissions over the modelled period. Using the 2000-2010 CO2 emission estimates as a baseline, CO2 emissions from passenger travel are then modelled to 2030 under scenarios exploring politically plausible strategies on transport (public transport infrastructure investment, and vehicle constraint), urban development (compaction) and vehicle technology (faster adoption of clean vehicle technology). The results showed that, compared to the trend scenario, employing both transport and urban development policies could reduce total passenger CO2 emission to 2030 by 24%, and by 43% if all strategies were applied together. The study reveals the potential of microsimulation in emission estimation for large cities in developing countries where data availability may constrain more traditional approaches.

On average for the 8-month samples, 52+/-20% of the PM10 was made up of PM1. The concentration of particulate n-alkanes was in the range of 75-265 ng m(-3) in PM1 and 89-346 ng m(-3) in PM10, considerably higher than the concentration levels measured at other urban areas. The mass content of n-alkanes in ambient submicron aerosol particles (PM1)(0.38%) was statistically higher than that in PM1-10 (0.13) and suggests that the n-alkanes exist mainly in PM1 in Kaohsiung city. The concentration ratio of the homologues (C-19-C-33) of alkanes indicated that homologues were associated with submicron particles in general and that there was a high level of fractions (0.87+/-0.09 for C-19) in PM1 for low carbon n-alkanes than for high carbon n-alkanes (0.64+/-0.09 for C-33). For all the collected samples in this study, the average and standard deviation of CPI (carbon preference index) was 1.26+/-0.17 for PM1 and 1.39+/-0.28 for PM1-10. The plant wax contributions to the total alkanes for PM1 and PM1-10 were estimated to be 13.4% (5.9-21.7%) and 17.1% (4.8-32.0%), respectively.

310,WOS:000310864700007,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the rapid urbanization of Chinese cities with a focus on the plans for a new, ongoing urban sub-centre in the north-west of Shanghai: Zhenru Urban Sub-Centre. Information-rich urbanization is a defining feature of the 21st century, reshaping cities and communities in China and in developing countries around the world. The scale and pace of change requires a solid systems approach of urban development. In 2011, China announced that it has reached an urbanization rate of 50%. If we take rapid urbanization as a given and that it is already well underway, it is still widely unclear what research needs to be conducted and policy changes made to support municipalities of fast transforming cities and to avoid repeating the development mistakes that have occurred in industrialized nations, i.e. driving urban growth with high consumption patterns without fully considering the environmental and social needs and occupants' behaviour and aspirations. This paper compares two cases of urban development patterns for new sub-centres for polycentric city structures: It relates to new urban sub-centres in Berlin (Germany) and Shanghai (China), and the relationship of these sub-centres to 'Network City' theory. Network theory is useful in this context as the 'network' metaphor and concepts of decentralization seem to have replaced the 'machine' metaphor which was based on efficiency based on the availability of cheap fossil fuels. As cities aim to move towards more resilient urban ecosystems and polycentric systems, the case of Potsdamer Platz Berlin, compared to Zhenru Sub-Centre in Shanghai, is discussed. Both are transport-oriented developments promoting mixed-use density and less car-dependency. According to documentation of the Shanghai municipality, Zhenru urban centre, which is currently in its planning phase, is supposed to become a 'new sustainable sub-centre for a growing metropolis'. Based on the Potsdamer Platz experience, a series of careful recommendations are formulated for the design and development of such centres, knowing that it is rather difficult to translate from one case to the other. The conclusion includes five lessons (recommendations) from Potsdamer Platz for the urban design of new sub-centres to ensure a delivery of economical, social and environmental sustainable outcomes. A core finding is that drawing lessons from the German case study for Chinese urbanization seemed a useful tactic and gave a sense that there are underlying urban design strategies. However, the conversion of such strategies to another cultural and social context requires further research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet local climate policies suffer from a lack of scientific understanding and evaluation methods able to support the definition of efficient mitigation strategies. The purpose of this paper is to build on classical approaches in the energy policy field that exist at the national and international level to propose an urban MACCs methodology able to fulfill this lack and inform local debates. The methodology is an extension of static ""expert-based"" MACCs; it combines a land use transport integrated model and an abatement cost methodology that integrates co-benefits, and takes into account the spatial and systemic dimensions of cities. The methodology is implemented for the transportation sector of a mid-sized European city (Grenoble, France). Our results present the cost-effectiveness and political feasibility of several proposed measures. We find that the inclusion of co-benefits can profoundly change the cost-benefit assessment of transport mitigation options. Moreover we underline the key parameters determining the cost-effectiveness ranking of mitigation options. These urban MACCs aim to serve as a bridge between urban planning and mitigation policies and can thus contribute to strengthen and align sustainable and climate change agendas at the local level.

Trees are assigned to hardiness zones, which are based on the average annual minimum temperature that a species can thrive. In recent decades, human induced global warming has shifted the location of hardiness zones across the United States. Our study examines the historical range of similar to 200 common US tree species and how climate change-induced shifts in hardiness zones are affecting historical tree ranges in 20 highly populated metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with high rates of urban heat island growth over time. MSAs are areas with at least one urban area of 50,000 or more people and adjoining territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core. We found 6 of the 20 MSAs lost tree species, with the Atlanta (13.51%) and Washington DC (3.61%) MSAs suffering the greatest losses. If historical rates of hardiness zone migration continue, a simple projection exhibits >6% average tree species loss across all MSAs in the study. As hardiness zones continue to migrate northward with climate change, heat island mitigation and other environmental management strategies employing green infrastructure must identify tree species that are likely to remain well adapted to urban climates many years into the future.

Living Labs have emerged as a new research concept in which users, traditionally considered as observed subjects and end clients, become co-creators of the innovation process. As opposed to classical approaches, which may fail due to the contradictions among political, ecological, socioeconomic and technological interests, the user centred approach allows the emergence of a sustainable answer in a complex eco-system in a real life context. The first result of this study was the success associated with involving many participants - craftsmen, students, end-users, local authorities, material producers which enabled an efficient and acceptable solution to be found for refurbishment. Another issue was the improvement of both energy efficiency and hydrothermal indoor comfort for the end-users. Longer term results will be the reduction of fuel poverty for occupants, and a city centre that is alive and enjoyable to live in again. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

322,WOS:000344212600006,"South Africa's Province of Gauteng is a fast growing megacity region including the cities of Johannesburg and Tshwane. Increasing population and prosperity lead to a steadily growing energy demand and thereby increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One third of the province's final energy consumption comes from the transport sector, dominated by motorized individual transport. Due to the limited financial resources to fund public transport initiatives, the most cost-effective means to reach the GHG mitigation targets are intended, without jeopardizing the economic growth. Recently, a bus rapid transit (BRT) system (Rea Vaya) and a rapid rail link (Gautrain) have been introduced to enforce the public transport system. In this paper, we investigate planned and possible future network expansions of the BRT and the Gautrain in terms of transport performance, costs of network expansions and GHG mitigation potential. Based on a trip rate model, we show that extensions of the current network can increase passenger numbers significantly (between 320% and 660% between 2013 and 2040 depending on the framework conditions). However, despite these expansions, the modal share of the BRT and the Gautrain in total passenger-kilometres travelled remains below 4% until 2040. This results in a decrease of cumulated GHG emissions of less than 1% until 2040 and relatively high GHG mitigation costs (4948-30045 ZAR(2013)/t CO(2)e). Nevertheless, a better integration of all public transport systems can increase the attractiveness of the services, which can result in a higher modal shift from private cars and thereby higher GHG emissions reductions at lower costs.

323,WOS:000349875900033,"In this study, a fuzzy-interval possibilistic programming (FIPP) method is developed for supporting sustainable electric power system (EPS) planning with carbon emission abatement under uncertainty. In FIPP, systematic uncertainties expressed as crisp intervals and fuzzy-boundary intervals can be effectively tackled. A FIPP-based clean development mechanism (FIPP-CDM) model is formulated for realizing CO2-emission reduction and adjusting energy mix of Shenzhen's EPS with cost-effective and sustainable ways. Located in the south of Guangdong Province of southern China, the City of Shenzhen is one of fastest-growing cities in the world and has experienced high-speed economic development, accelerated industrialization process, and increased population growth. This is the first attempt to introduce CDM into Shenzhen's EPS with carbon emission abatement, while sustainable EPS's transition pathways are explored through FIPP-CDM model. Results demonstrate that (a) city's energy supply structure tends to the transition from coal-dominated into clean energy-dominated; (b) local renewable energy development is motivated through CDM projects; (c) city's power generation mix is diversified by wind power and solar power, while renewable energy accounts for 2.12%; (d) an additional capacity of [4.88, 5.82] GW of CDM projects is added, contributing to a [15.91, 17.221 % reduction in CO2 emission of fossil fuel-fired power (i.e., corresponding to emission-reduction of 171.59, 85.511 million tonne).

Lowering peak demand to reduce the use of carbon-intensive fuels and the number of expensive peaking plant generators is thus of major importance. Self-adaptive control methods for individual batteries have been developed to reduce the peak demand. However, these self-adaptive control algorithms of are not very efficient without sharing the energy among different batteries. This paper proposes a novel battery network system with optimal management of energy between batteries. An optimal management strategy has been implemented using a population-based constraint differential evolution algorithm. Taking advantage of this strategy the battery network model can remove more peak areas of forecasted demand data compared to the self-adaptive control algorithm developed for the New York City study case.

Management of regional energy systems is a complex task due to the strong interactions among energy supply, demand and conversion activities, as well as those among energy, environmental and economic factors. These complexities may be further compounded due to the presence of uncertainties in a variety of processes and the related costs, impact factors and objectives. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a dynamic interval-fuzzy two-stage stochastic regional energy systems planning model (DIFT-REM) and analysis GHG-emission reduction policies within a general energy management systems framework. The developed model is then applied to the Province of Ontario to demonstrate its applicability in supporting regional energy systems management and GHG-emission reduction analysis under uncertainty. The results indicated that DIFT-REM could address not only interactions among multiple energy-related activities, but also uncertainties in multiple forms and dynamics within a multi-period, multi-facility, multi-scale and multi-uncertainty context.

Applied to Delhi, India, the analysis demonstrates that city-scale action can rival typical food policy interventions that occur at larger scales, although no single city-scale action can rival in all three environmental impacts. In particular, improved food-waste management within the city (7% system-wide GHG reduction) matches the GHG impact of preconsumer trans-boundary food waste reduction. The systems approach is particularly useful in illustrating key trade-offs and co-benefits. For instance, multiple diet shifts that can reduce GHG emissions have trade-offs that increase water and land impacts. Vertical farming technology (VFT) with current applications for fruits and vegetables can provide modest system-wide water (4%) and land reductions (3%), although implementation within the city itself may raise questions of constraints in water-stressed cities, with such a shift in Delhi increasing community-wide direct water use by 16%.

In this paper, based on the large-scale datasets of soil surveys in 1982 and 2009 for Pinggu District an urban-rural ecotone of Beijing, China, the effects of land use and land use changes on both temporal variation and spatial variation of SOC were analyzed. Results showed that from 1982 to 2009 in Pinggu District, the following land use change mainly occurred: Grain cropland converted to orchard or vegetable land, and grassland converted to forestland. The SOC content decreased in region where the land use type changed to grain cropland (e.g., vegetable land to grain cropland decreased by 0.7 g kg-1; orchard to grain cropland decreased by 0.2 g kg(-1)). In contrast, the SOC content increased in region where the land use type changed to either orchard (excluding forestland) or forestland (e.g., grain cropland to orchard and forestland increased by 2.7 and 2.4 g kg(-1), respectively; grassland to orchard and forestland increased by 4.8 and 4.9 g kg(-1), respectively). The organic carbon accumulation capacity per unit mass of the soil increased in the following order: grain cropland soil<vegetable land/grassland soil<orchard soil<forestland soil.

The purpose of this study was to measure Los Angeles's existing tree canopy cover (TCC), determine if space exists for 1 million additional trees, and estimate future benefits from the planting. High-resolution QuickBird remote sensing data, aerial photographs, and geographic information systems were used to classify land cover types, measure TCC, and identify potential tree planting sites. Benefits were forecast for planting of 1 million trees between 2006 and 2010, and their growth and mortality were projected until 2040. Two scenarios reflected low (17%) and high (56%) mortality rates. Numerical models were used with geographic data and tree size information for coastal and inland climate zones to calculate annual benefits and their monetary value. Los Angeles's existing TCC was 21%, and ranged from 7 to 37% by council district. There was potential to add 2.5 million additional trees to the existing population of approximately 10.8 million, but only 1.3 million of the potential tree sites are deemed realistic to plant.

331,WOS:000322419700002,"At an official ceremony attended by around 400 guests, Lanxess inaugurated its new butyl rubber plant on Jurong Island in Singapore on schedule. The specialty chemicals company has invested approximately EUR 400 million in the plant, which will have a capacity of 100,000 metric tons. The plant will create about 160 highly qualified new jobs that will mainly be filled locally. The facility is the most modern of its kind in Asia and will produce halobutyl rubber, as well as regular butyl rubber. Jurong Island is located off the coast of the city-state and offers an infrastructure geared specifically to the needs of the chemical industry, thus providing ideal conditions. The newly opened plant in Singapore joins existing butyl rubber plants in Sarnia, Canada, and Zwijndrecht, Belgium. The butyl rubber market is expected to grow on average by 5 percent in the coming years, with the main driving force being the megatrend mobility, above all in Asia. Modern radial tires require an inner liner made of halobutyl rubber, which helps keep tire pressure constant for longer because of its impermeability to gases, thus saving fuel and reducing CO2 emissions. A new application for bromobutyl rubber, a type of halobutyl, is in the tread of tires. Another use for halobutyl rubber is in pharmaceutical closures. Other applications for butyl rubber are protective clothing, shoe soles, adhesives and chewing gum.

This research presents a process for developing and analyzing retrofit strategies for specific housing archetypes using Toronto (Canada) as a case study. The process was applied to three Toronto urban archetypes with two separate energy intensity goals for heating and cooling: (1) 75 kWh/m(2) and (2) Passive House EnerPHit estimated equivalency. Building data was collected through field study and calibrated baseline energy models (EnergyPlus) were created. Retrofit strategies were identified and costs were estimated in consultancy with several experienced Toronto-based retrofit contractors. The process utilized a Brute Force method for retrofit selection considering the cost/benefit of each strategy. Furnace and select building envelope parameters were shown to be priorities while windows were not. Energy use reductions of 64-67% and 88-89% from a baseline were achieved when meeting the 75 kWh/m(2) and EnerPHit equivalency targets, respectively. The capital costs of $30,000-$80,000 to achieve the retrofit targets are likely to be prohibitive for homeowners, suggesting that a government funded program is necessary to achieve deep energy retrofits of this nature and to ensure early adoption leading to widespread market growth.

We developed separate models that linked transport scenarios with physical activity, air pollution, and risk of road traffic injury. in both cities, we noted that reduction in carbon dioxide emissions through an increase in active travel and less use of motor vehicles had larger health benefits per million population (7332 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] in London, and 12 516 in Delhi in 1 year) than from the increased use of lower-emission motor vehicles (160 DALYs in London, and 1696 in Delhi). However, combination of active travel and lower-emission motor vehicles would give the largest benefits (7439 DALYs in London, 12 995 in Delhi), notably from a reduction in the number of years of life lost from ischaemic heart disease (10-19% in London, 11-25% in Delhi).

After analyzing PM2.5 data at 12 cities in the region in 2006, we found that PM2.5 concentrations were 30-40% higher in summer (7-15 mu g/m(3)) than in winter (4-11 mu g/m(3)). High PM2.5 episodes occurred more frequently in warmer seasons. Analyses of surface meteorology, weather maps, and airflow trajectories suggest that these PM2.5 episodes were often related to synoptic transport of pollutants from highly polluted areas in the United States. The southerly or southwesterly winds associated with midlatitude cyclones play an important role in such transport. A typical weather pattern favoring the transport is suggested. When it was hot, humid, and stagnant with southerly or southwesterly winds, the likelihood of high PM2.5 occurrences was high. The Greater Golden Horseshoe and Southwestern Ontario regions had higher PM2.5 (6-12 mu g/m(3) annually) than the northern region (4-6 mu g/m(3)), reflecting combined effects of meteorology, regional transport, and local emissions.

The results are as follow: (1) Carbon emissions within Scope 1+2 only take up 66.14% of total carbon footprint, while emissions within Scope 3 which have usually been ignored account for 33.84%. (2) Industry is the most carbon-intensive end use sector which contributes 32.74% of the total carbon footprint and 55.13% of energy use emissions in Scope 1+2.

The study focuses on the performance of models used to assess impacts of pollutants on climate and air quality as part of the EU ECLIPSE project. Models, run using the same ECLIPSE emissions, are compared over different spatial scales to in situ surface, vertical profiles and satellite data. Several rather clear biases are found between model results and observations, including overestimation of ozone at rural locations downwind of the main emission regions in China, as well as downwind over the Pacific. Several models produce too much ozone over polluted regions, which is then transported downwind. Analysis points to different factors related to the ability of models to simulate VOC-limited regimes over polluted regions and NOx limited regimes downwind. This may also be linked to biases compared to satellite NO2, indicating overestimation of NO2 over and to the north of the northern China Plain emission region. On the other hand, model NO2 is too low to the south and west of this region and over South Korea/Japan. Overestimation of ozone is linked to systematic underestimation of CO particularly at rural sites and downwind of the main Chinese emission regions. This is likely to be due to enhanced destruction of CO by OH. Overestimation of Asian ozone and its transport downwind implies that radiative forcing from this source may be overestimated. Model-observation discrepancies over Beijing do not appear to be due to emission controls linked to the Olympic Games in summer 2008. With regard to aerosols, most models reproduce the satellite-derived AOD patterns over eastern China. Our study nevertheless reveals an overestimation of ECLIPSE model mean surface BC and sulphate aerosols in urban China in summer 2008. The effect of the short-term emission mitigation in Beijing is too weak to explain the differences between the models. Our results rather point to an overestimation of SO2 emissions, in particular, close to the surface in Chinese urban areas. However, we also identify a clear underestimation of aerosol concentrations over northern India, suggesting that the rapid recent growth of emissions in India, as well as their spatial extension, is underestimated in emission inventories. Model deficiencies in the representation of pollution accumulation due to the Indian monsoon may also be playing a role. Comparison with vertical aerosol lidar measurements highlights a general underestimation of scattering aerosols in the boundary layer associated with overestimation in the free troposphere pointing to modelled aerosol lifetimes that are too long. This is likely linked to too strong vertical transport and/or insufficient deposition efficiency during transport or export from the boundary layer, rather than chemical processing (in the case of sulphate aerosols). Underestimation of sulphate in the boundary layer implies potentially large errors in simulated aerosol-cloud interactions, via impacts on boundary-layer clouds. This evaluation has important implications for accurate assessment of air pollutants on regional air quality and global climate based on global model calculations. Ideally, models should be run at higher resolution over source regions to better simulate urban-rural pollutant gradients and/or chemical regimes, and also to better resolve pollutant processing and loss by wet deposition as well as vertical transport. Discrepancies in vertical distributions require further quantification and improvement since these are a key factor in the determination of radiative forcing from short-lived pollutants.","Quennehen, B, Quennehen, B, Raut, JC, Law, KS, Daskalakis, N, Daskalakis, N, Daskalakis, N, Ancellet, G, Clerbaux, C, Kim, SW, Lund, MT, Myhre, G, Olivie, DJL, Safieddine, S, Safieddine, S, Skeie, RB, Thomas, JL, Tsyro, S, Bazureau, A, Bellouin, N, Hu, M, Kanakidou, M, Klimont, Z, Kupiainen, K, Myriokefalitakis, S, Myriokefalitakis, S, Quaas, J, Rumbold, ST, Rumbold, ST, Schulz, M, Cherian, R, Shimizu, A, Wang, J, Yoon, SC, Zhu, T",5,Beijing,CHN,10.5194/acp-16-10765-2016,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,Multi-model evaluation of short-lived pollutant distributions over east Asia during summer 2008,2016

Community is the main unit of urban housing, public facilities, transportation, and other properties of city's land use. The construction of low-carbon community is an important pathway to realize carbon emission mitigation in the context of rapid urbanization. Therefore, an efficient carbon accounting framework should be proposed for CO2 emissions mitigation at a subcity level. Based on life-cycle analysis (LCA), a three-tier accounting framework for the carbon emissions of the community is put forward, including emissions from direct fossil fuel combustion, purchased energy (electricity, heat, and water), and supply chain emissions embodied in the consumption of goods. By compiling a detailed CO2 emission inventory, the magnitude of carbon emissions and the mitigation potential in a typical high-quality community in Beijing are quantified within the accounting framework proposed. Results show that emissions from supply chain emissions embodied in the consumption of goods cannot be ignored. Specific suggestions are also provided for the urban decision makers to achieve the optimal resource allocation and further promotion of low-carbon communities.","Song, D, Su, MR, Yang, J, Chen, B",6,Beijing,CHN,10.1100/2012/613721,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,Greenhouse Gas Emission Accounting and Management of Low-Carbon Community,2012

One way for cities to adapt is by enhancing their green infrastructure (GI) to mitigate the impacts of heat waves and flooding. While alternative GI design options exist, there are many unknoWns regarding public support for the various options. This study aims to fill this gap by performing a socio-cultural valuation of urban GI for climate adaptation that encompasses multiple dimensions: people's notion of and concerns about climate impacts, the degree to which people acknowledge the benefits of GI to alleviate such impacts, and people's preferences for different GI measures, including their willingness to pay (WTP). Data were collected through photo-assisted face-to-face surveys (n=200.) with residents in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and linked to GI GIS data. Respondents had a notion of and concerns about climate impacts, but did not necessarily acknowledge that GI may help tackle these issues. Yet, when residents were informed about the adaptation capacity of different GI measures, their preferences shifted towards the most effective options. There was no information effect, however, on people's WTP for GI, which was mostly related to income and ethnicity. Our study shows that economic valuation alone would miss nuances that socio-cultural valuation as applied in this paper can reveal. The method revealed preferences for particular adaptation designs, and assists in detecting why policy for climate adaptation may be hampered. Understanding people's views on climate impacts and adaptation options is crucial for prioritizing effective policy responses in the face of climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There has been a strong push globally for CHP due to its climate mitigation potential compared to separate production, and consequently it is often prioritized in planning without questioning. However, the uncertainties in assessing the emissions from CHP and alternative options in a certain planning situation make it very difficult to give robust decision guidelines. In addition, even the order of magnitude of the climate impact of a certain plan is actually difficult to assess robustly. With a case study of the new residential development of Harmalanranta in Tampere, Finland, we show how strongly the uncertainties related to (1) utilizing average or marginal electricity as the reference; (2) assigning emissions intensities for the production; and (3) allocating the emissions from CHP to heat and electricity affect the results and lead to varying decision guidelines. We also depict how a rather rarely utilized method in assigning the emissions from CHP is the most robust for planning support.","Heinonen, J, Laine, J, Pluuman, K, Saynajoki, ES, Soukka, R, Junnila, S",3,Tampere,FIN,10.3390/en8099137,SRID=4326;POINT (23.78712 61.49911),202687,Planning for a Low Carbon Future?

Processes such as peak car, rail renaissance and cycling boom manifest themselves particularly in cities, and success stories of cities experimenting with specific types of low-energy mobility abound in the academic literature. Nonetheless, innovation is known to be a precarious process requiring favorable circumstances. Using document analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the nature of low-energy innovation in the everyday mobility of people in two UK cities with favorable conditions for a transition away from fossil fuels-Brighton and Oxford. It shows that clear differences exist between the two cities in the sorts of innovation that emerge and diffuse as a result of path dependencies, local politics, and financial support from supra-local governments and agencies. While low-energy mobility currently has substantial momentum in both cities, the majority of low-carbon innovations in urban mobility are incremental rather than radical in nature, and their future is often imbued with uncertainty. The autonomy of small- and medium-sized cities as agents in bringing about transformational change toward low-energy urban mobility should not be overestimated.","Schwanen, T",6,Oxford; Brighton,GBR; GBR,10.3390/su7067086,SRID=4326;POINT (-1.25596 51.75222); SRID=4326;POINT (-0.13947 50.82838),154566; 139001,The Bumpy Road toward Low-Energy Urban Mobility: Case Studies from Two UK Cities,2015

Real estate development has shown to be a major driving factor of the growth in indirect energy consumption. The boom and bust of construction activities have been strongly correlated with the increase and decrease of system-side indirect energy consumption. Traditional heavy industries remain the most energy-intensive sectors in the economy. However, the transportation and service sectors have contributed most to the rapid increase in overall energy consumption.

The creation of such islands will affect the landscape, climate and environment through the replacement of sand and water with hard artificial surfaces and buildings. Exposing urban man-made surfaces, such as roads and buildings, to the sun increases the temperatures of their surfaces and the atmosphere, and consequently impacts upon the local weather, building energy consumption and people's thermal comfort through the modification of microclimatic variables such air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. The current body of work represents the results of field measurements and simulation studies that assessed modifications in urban temperatures of the man-made AMWAJ Islands in the Kingdom of Bahrain, and examined thermal comfort and cooling energy demand on the islands. This work argues that the urban temperatures of AMWAJ Islands were altered in part due to human contributions such as urban geometry, urban surfaces and land use. The modification in temperature could reach almost 5 degrees C. In turn, thermal comfort and cooling demand within AMWAJ islands were affected by the modified temperatures. The increase in urban cooling load was within the range of 14-26% when compared with uninhabited islands. The presence of green surfaces, in conjunction with water bodies that overlap with the infrastructure, help to improve thermal comfort and consequently reduce cooling energy requirements in AMWAJ Islands.

We examined an association between diesel and petrol prices and four traffic-related pollutants in Brisbane from 2010 to 2013. We used a regression model and examined pollution levels up to 16 days after the price change. Higher diesel prices were associated with statistically significant short-term reductions in carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Changes in petrol prices had no impact on air pollution.

The annual average concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and elemental carbon (EC) were modelled separately in busy street canyons, near urban motorways and in the remainder of the urban area. It was concluded that traffic-related CO2 emissions in 2020-BAU could be expected to remain at the levels of 2010 in Basel and Rotterdam, while in Xi'an and Suzhou to increase 30-50% due to growth in the traffic volume. Traffic-related CO2 emissions may be reduced by up to 5% and 25%, respectively using the first and second scenarios. Air pollution in the Chinese cities is a factor 3 to 5 higher than in the European cities in 2010 and 2020-BAU. The impact of both CO2 reduction scenarios on air quality in 2020-BAU is limited. In Europe, due to implementation of stringent emission standards in all sectors, air quality is expected to improve at both the urban background and near busy road traffic. In China, the regional background is expected to improve for EC, stabilize for PM2.5 and PM10, and decrease for NO2. The urban background follows this regional trend, while near busy road traffic, air pollution will remain elevated due to the considerable growth in traffic volume. A major constraint for modelling air quality in China is access to the input data required and lack of measurements at ground level for validation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the benefits of CVs, a modeling framework is developed based on traffic microsimulation for a real network located in the city of Toronto, Canada, to mimic communication between enabled vehicles. In this study, we examine the effects of providing real-time routing guidance and advisory warning messages to CVs. In addition, to take into account the rerouting in nonconnected vehicles (non-CVs) in response to varying sources of information such as apps, global positioning systems (GPS), variable message signs (VMS), or simply seeing the traffic back up, the impact of fraction of non-CV vehicles was also considered and evaluated. Therefore, vehicles in this model are divided into; uninformed/unfamiliar not connected (non-CV), informed/familiar but not connected (non-CV) that get updates infrequently every 5 minutes or so (non-CV), and connected vehicles that receive information more frequently (CV). The results demonstrate the potential of connected vehicles to improve mobility, enhance safety, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) at the network-wide level. The results also show quantitatively how the market penetration of connected vehicles proportionally affects the performance of the traffic network.

In Taipei, the residential and commercial sector contributes more than 78% of the total GHG emission. Thus, in a business as usual scenario, the total GHG emission in 2030 would be 79% more than that in 2005, far more than the target value proclaimed. As many key factors are uncontrollable by the local government, a target-aimed strategy designing process by looking into changes in Taipei and identifying major targets is proposed in this study. It is demonstrated that such a universally applicable approach will give more confidence to the public on working toward the expected GHG reduction goal. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

359,WOS:000402137900019,"The rapid urbanisation of the twentieth century, along with the spread of high-consumption urban lifestyles, has led to cities becoming the dominant drivers of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing these impacts is crucial, but production-based frameworks of carbon measurement and mitigation-which encompass only a limited part of cities' carbon footprints-are much more developed and widely applied than consumption-based approaches that consider the embedded carbon effectively imported into a city. Frequently, therefore, cities are left blind to the importance of their wider consumption-related climate impacts, while at the same time left lacking effective tools to reduce them. To explore the relevance of these issues, we implement methodologies for assessing production- and consumption-based emissions at the city-level and estimate the associated emissions trajectories for Bristol, a major UK city, from 2000 to 2035. We develop mitigation scenarios targeted at reducing the former, considering potential energy, carbon and financial savings in each case. We then compare these mitigation potentials with local government ambitions and Bristol's consumption-based emissions trajectory. Our results suggest that the city's consumption-based emissions are three times the production-based emissions, largely due to the impacts of imported food and drink. We find that low-carbon investments of circa A 3 pound billion could reduce production-based emissions by 25% in 2035. However, we also find that this represents < 10% of Bristol's forecast consumption-based emissions for 2035 and is approximately equal to the mitigation achievable by eliminating the city's current levels of food waste. Such observations suggest that incorporating consumption-based emission statistics into cities' accounting and decision-making processes could uncover largely unrecognised opportunities for mitigation that are likely to be essential for achieving deep decarbonisation.",,2,Bristol,GBR,10.1007/s10113-017-1112-x,SRID=4326;POINT (-2.59665 51.45523),430713,"Uncovering blind spots in urban carbon management: the role of consumption-based carbon accounting in Bristol, UK",2017

In addition to energy policies and the use of fuel-efficient vehicles, CO2 emissions and fuel consumption can be lowered through the application of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies that can affect drivers' route choice decision-making process and reduce congestion. Ecological route (eco-route) planning is one such strategy that provides the least CO2 emission and fuel consumption routes for vehicles. In this article, a set of mesoscopic vehicle emission and fuel consumption models are established based on locally collected vehicle operation and emission data, and these models are more appropriate for evaluating the effectiveness of ITS strategies with sufficient estimation accuracy. Based on the proposed models and a dynamic traffic information database, an eco-route planning algorithm is proposed as well, which is expected to be consistent with the road network characteristics of China cities. Furthermore, the environmental impact of the eco-route is fully evaluated with tests undertaken in Beijing urban areas. The results show that the proposed eco-route algorithm significantly reduces fuel consumption and has good environmental performance.","Yao, EJ, Song, YY",24,Beijing,CHN,10.1080/15472450.2013.747822,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,Study on Eco-Route Planning Algorithm and Environmental Impact Assessment,2013

However, given increasing expectations of indoor thermal comfort and an increasing dependency on modern living technologies, energy consumption in the urban historic environment is expected to rise. This paper examines the retrofitting of windows to historic buildings and issues of energy consumption and carbon emission in Lhasa's historic city centre, focusing on the relationship between energy use and window retrofitting. First, the thermal performance of a traditional Tibetan building in Lhasa is simulated and examined. Second, four window types for retrofitting are evaluated through computer modelling and their impacts on energy consumption are compared. Finally, the energy demand and carbon emission of the whole historic city centre with various window types are estimated and compared. In terms of energy efficiency and historic preservation, current single-layered window retrofitting practices perform badly, while windows with wooden frames and secondary glazing may achieve better performance. The approach offers the opportunity to halve the energy consumption and carbon emissions in the Lhasa historic city centre.","Huang, LJ, Huang, ZD, Hamza, N",1,Lhasa,CHN,10.1080/02513625.2014.979043,SRID=4326;POINT (91.09999999999999 29.65),118721,Energy-efficient retrofitting and energy consumption in a historic city centre - an example from Lhasa,2014

The discussion is based on the evaluation of three key ecosystem services: (1) cooling effects, (2) routes for non-motorized transport, and (3) flood mitigation. The integration of concepts of green infrastructure, ecosystem services and adaptation/mitigation of climate change, provide an appropriate framework to clarify how urban green spaces can contribute to address global warming and the negative effects of climate change. In Santiago, currently the main contribution of Mapocho River's riparian corridor is to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by acting as an important route for non-motorized transport, particularly for cycling. Currently its contribution to the reduction of atmospheric temperatures and to flood mitigation is limited.

As a first step, a detailed emission inventory following the IPCC guidelines for Wuxi has been carried out. In a second step, the future development of energy demand and related CO2 emissions in 2050 were simulated in a current policy scenario (CPS). In parallel, selected aspects of material and water flows for the energy and the building sector were analyzed and modeled. In addition, recent and future climate impacts and vulnerability were investigated. Based on these findings, nine key sectors with high relevance to the three dimensions could be identified.

New patterns of thermal transitions were identified that significantly modified the seasonal subjects' thermal perception, and their reactions to temperature changes. Results suggest that it could be possible to positively alter people's thermal perception in the short- and long-term through the judicious use of lobby spaces.

This sudden growth is resulting in increasing traffic congestion, fuel use, and CO2 emissions and in deteriorating air quality. This paper presents a common framework to explore scenarios of vehicle and energy use and emissions in three South Asian cities: Bangalore, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; and Dhaka, Bangladesh. Scenarios are built by separately analyzing transportation activity (in tonne kilometers or passenger kilometers), modal structure (i.e., share of tonne kilometers or passenger kilometers occurring on each mode), modal energy intensity (in energy burned per tonne kilometer or passenger kilometer), and emission factors. Although the types of data available across cities vary widely and there are deficiencies and inconsistencies in the available data, the analysis suggests that motor vehicle use would roughly double in each city by 2020 in the business-as-usual scenario, largely because of expected income increases; fuel use and CO2 emissions would triple; and pollution loading would rise exponentially. An alternative scenario of slower vehicle and energy growth is explored, premised on substitution of personal vehicles with buses and reduction in traffic congestion. Consequently, fuel use and CO2 emissions would only double in Bangalore and Dhaka, whereas in Colombo the increase would not be significantly lower than in the business-as-usual scenario. The cumulative carbon mitigation potential over a 15-year period would be 13% in Bangalore, 9% in Dhaka, and 2% in Colombo.

Merging supply and demand maps allows to quantify the residential heating demand coverage through local waste heat in the potential supply areas within different distance ranges and housing density classes. In high density housing areas, only a small share of the demand can be covered by waste heat supply even within 250 m distance from sources due to few companies which could provide waste heat. In medium to low density housing areas in Vienna's outer districts with more industry, a higher share of residential heating demand near the sources can be covered by waste heat within a 250 m distance.

Direct incineration method is one such system. The aim of this work was to analyze the municipal solid waste incineration plant currently under construction in the province of Turin (Piedmont, North Italy), especially the potential for energy recovery, and the consequent environmental effects. We analyzed two kinds of energy recovery: electric energy (electrical configuration) only, and both electric and thermal energy (cogenerative configuration), in this case with a different connection hypothesis to the district heating network. After we had evaluated the potential of the incinerator and considered local demographic, energy and urban planning effects, we assumed different possible connections to the district heating network. We computed the local and global environmental balances based on the characteristics of the flue gas emitted from the stack, taking into consideration the emissions avoided by the substituted sources. The global-scale results provided relevant information on the carbon dioxide emissions parameter. The results on the local scale were used as reference values for the implementation of a Gaussian model (Aermod) that allows evaluation of the actual concentration of the pollutants released into the atmosphere. The main results obtained highlight the high energy efficiency of the combined production of heat and electricity, and the opportunity to minimize the environmental impact by including cogeneration in a district heating scheme.","Panepinto, D, Genon, G",6,Turin,ITA,10.1177/0734242X14538304,SRID=4326;POINT (7.68682 45.07049),870456,Environmental evaluation of the electric and cogenerative configurations for the energy recovery of the Turin municipal solid waste incineration plant,2014

Two prototypes of the new carbon-filtered PREP Marlboro UltraSmooth (MUS) were investigated using both standard (FTC/ISO) and intensive (Health Canada) machine methods to measure gas/ vapor- and particulate-phase smoke constituents. Basic physical design characteristics that may influence smoke constituent yields, such as ventilation, pressure drop (resistance to draw), quantity of tobacco, and quantity and type of carbon, were measured. The possible presence of added chemical flavorant compounds was investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. MUS prototypes were found to have several key differences in physical design compared with a conventional cigarette, including higher ventilation, lower draw, resistance, and in the case of the Salt Lake City prototype, the use of vitreous carbon beads and the presence of chemical flavorants on both the beads and an embedded filter fiber. When tested under the standard regimen, gas-phase constituents of MUS prototypes were reduced compared with a conventional low-yield cigarette. However, far smaller reductions in gas-phase constituents were observed under the intensive regimen, suggesting that the carbon technology used in MUS is less effective when smoked under more intensive conditions.

The energy use in urban buildings in Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai share approximately 90% of whole energy consumption in buildings. Amongst these urban buildings, the energy use in public buildings is higher than other building sectors. So, the public building sector thus is an area of priority with regard to energy conservation and carbon reduction. China's Ministry of Construction has issued six energy-efficiency design standards to the building sector since 1995. The latest one is the design standards for energy efficiency in public buildings which aim to achieve 50% of the reduction of energy consumption in new and refurbished public buildings. Beijing and Shanghai governments have also issued their local energy saving standards for the public buildings with 65% and 50% of energy-saving goals. The main problems and weaknesses existing in the national and local standards in Beijing and Shanghai are assessed, and the reasons for producing the barriers to the implementation of national and two local standards are explored in this paper, they include: a) no explicit definitions of the base load energy consumption and the space conditioning energy uses are given, and only the energy savings from the base load energy consumption is considered in current standards; b) the benchmark of energy consumption selected is unreasonable and energy cuts from non technical measures are ignored; and c) the lack of effective supervision. Relevant solutions and suggestions to tackle these problems and weaknesses for the long-term energy conservation development in public buildings are discussed in this paper.

The growing need for oil independence and CO2 mitigation has lead to the increasing importance of alternative fuel usage. CO2 is produced not only as the fuel is used in the vehicle (tank-to-wheel contribution), but also upstream, from the fuel extraction to the refueling station (well-to-tank contribution), and the life cycle of the ftiel production (well-to-wheel contribution) must be considered in order to analyse the global impact of the fuel utilization. A road vehicle tank-to-wheel analysis tool that may be integrated with well-to-tank models was developed in the present study.

An important factor is related to the presence of significant water losses, which result in an increase in the supply volume and therefore a higher energy consumption for treatment and pumping, without effectively supplying users. The current European environmental strategy is committed to sustainable development by generating action plans to improve the environmental performance of products and services. The analysis of carbon footprints is considered one such improvement, allowing for the evaluation of the environmental impact of single production phases. Using this framework, the aim of the study is to apply a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to quantify the carbon footprint of an overall integrated urban water system referring to ISO/TS 14067 (2013).

387,WOS:000341474100057,"Using plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) has become an important component of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction strategy in the transportation sector. Assessing the net effect of PEVs on GHG emissions, however, is dependent on factors such as type and scale of electricity generation sources, adoption rate, and charging behavior. This study creates a comprehensive model that estimates the energy load and GHG emissions impacts for the years 2020 and 2030 for the city of Los Angeles. For 2020, model simulations show that the PEV charging loads will be modest with negligible effects on the overall system load profile. Contrary to previous study results, the average marginal carbon intensity is higher if PEV charging occurs during off-peak hours. These results suggest that current economic incentives to encourage off-peak charging result in greater GHG emissions. Model simulations for 2030 show that PEV charging loads increase significantly resulting in potential generation shortages. There are also significant grid operation challenges as the region's energy grid is required to ramp up and down rapidly to meet PEV loads. For 2030, the average marginal carbon intensity for off-peak charging becomes lower than peak charging mainly due to the removal of coal from the power generation portfolio. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

388,WOS:000266050200006,"Many recent studies on waste management have described in detail the potential impacts of recycling and final treatment of municipal waste. In public debates, the attention has also been focused on the choice of final disposal technologies (e.g. landfilling vs. incineration). However, a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of waste collection and transport was still lacking. In the present study, we use LCA to evaluate the potential impact of the provincial waste management plan of Varese (northern Italy). Particular attention is devoted to the estimation of environmental impacts generated during waste transport. A detailed Life Cycle Inventory was built for the transportation phase, based on primary data collected by interviewing the agencies involved in waste collection. To model the recycling and final disposal phase we relied on the BUWAL 250 database. Impacts were evaluated with the Eco-Indicator 99 method in its egalitarian formulation. The results of our analysis reveal that the major potential impacts of the plan are associated with waste collection and transport. These impacts are partially compensated by reduced resource consumption through recycling and energy recovery through incineration. The outputs of the LCIA were compared with those obtained by using other ecoindicators (Eco-Indicator 99 hierarchist and individualist, CML2, EPS2000). Although not comparable on a quantitative basis, they are qualitatively consistent. Neglecting the effects of collection and transport might result in a severe underestimation of the environmental impacts of a waste management system, especially as refers to depletion of fossil fuels, emission of respiratory inorganics and climate change. To reduce the environmental impact of waste management systems, an accurate optimisation of waste transport is required.

However, systems-oriented approaches become imperative in pursuit of an efficient regulation of carbon emissions from systems as complicated as urban systems. The aim of this paper is to establish a dynamic network approach that is capable of assessing the effectiveness of carbon emissions mitigation in a more holistic way. A carbon metabolic network is constructed by modeling the carbon flows between economic sectors and environment. With the network shocked by interventions to the sectoral carbon flows, indirect emissions from the city are accounted for under certain carbon mitigation strategies. The nonzero-sum relationships between sectors and environmental components are identified based on utility analysis, which synthesize the nature of direct and indirect network interactions. The results of the case study of Beijing suggest that the stove-pipe mitigation strategies targeted the economic sectors might be not as efficient as they were expected. A direct cutting in material or energy import to the sectors may result in a rebound in indirect emissions and thus fails to achieve the carbon mitigation goal of the city as a whole. A promising way of foreseeing the dynamic mechanism of emissions is to analyze the nonzero-sum relationships between important urban components. Thinking cities as systems of interactions, the network approach is potentially a strong tool for appraising and filtering mitigation strategies of carbon emissions.","Chen, SQ, Chen, B, Su, MR",16,Beijing,CHN,10.1021/acs.est.5b02654,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,Nonzero-Sum Relationships in Mitigating Urban Carbon Emissions: A Dynamic Network Simulation,2015
392,WOS:000391516300083,"To translate scientific evidence into policy decisions, a universal, integrate and rapid-calculation model is needed for estimating the air quality associated health co-benefits of climate change mitigation strategies. This study developed such a greenhouse gas policy assessment model (GHG-PAM) based upon the annually published energy balances tables. To examine the applicability of this model, we select Suzhou, one of the national low-carbon pilot cities located in the east of China, as a case study. It was determined that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Suzhou would increase from 148 million tons in 2010 to 297, 284, 180, and 173 million tons in 2020 under Business As Usual (BAU), Industrial Structure Dominated (ISD), Technology Dominated (TD), and Integrate Carbon Reduction (ICR) scenarios, of which only ICR scenario meets its carbon intensity target. Under the ICR scenario, the implementation of greenhouse gas policies reduces the air pollution associated burden of diseases, measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY), by 44.1% in 2020 compared to BAU, although even with this scenario the burden of diseases would still be higher than that in 2010. In addition, the model can also identify sectors and industries with greater health co-benefits per unit CO2 emission reduction, which provides a useful guide for Suzhou's climate policy makers to formulate cost-effective measures. However, it should be carefully used where there is a mismatch between sectors with high potential for CO2 emission reductions and sectors with high health co-benefits per unit CO2 emission reduction.

This study estimates the possible energy saving and reduction in CO2 emission by the use of GSHP technology for space heating and cooling applications in cities located in and around the Himalayan region. For the purpose of analysis a building with 120 m(2) with a medium level of insulation has been considered. Currently, the buildings located in these cities meet their heating and cooling demands by conventional techniques. A detailed study has been carried out to estimate the investment cost, payback period, technical feasibility, greenhouse saving and risk associated with the implementation of GSHP technology using RETScreen tool. The analysis shows that if GSHPs were used in the above cities, they can be ordered based on lower to higher payback period as Darjeeling, Tawang, Shimla, Dehradun, Srinagar, Nangal, Shillong, Chandigarh, Saharanpur and Delhi. The minimum length of ground heat exchanger to supply the required heating and cooling is found to be 140 m for heavy rock ground formation and it is affected by different types of ground formations. In any place if the ground formation is a heavy rock, then the length required to meet the building demand is drastically reduced. If the ground formation is a light soil with no moisture, then the length of the heat exchanger is increased multifold. Whenever the knowledge of ground formation is not known thermal response test has to be performed. Countries like India can offer incentives and tax benefits to promote GSHP technologies in order to achieve significant saving in electricity and reduction in CO2 emission. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

If MSL rise is one meter, the crest of these structures will have to be raised between two and three meters in order to keep the same overtopping volumes. Moreover the structures will have more severe damages and mass of armour units should be doubled. Statistics moderate the first conclusions because it keeps into account the whole set of events, including in particular shoaling waves. Schematically with the increase of damages, according to the severity of changes the stakeholders will adopt one of the following scenarios: a) repairing the structures as it is b) reinforcing the structures c) demolishing and redesigning the structures d) accepting coastal realignment. Three axes of reinforcement of structures are presented: limiting overtopping by modifying for example the crown wall, improving armour stability by adding an armour layer or by using milder armour slope and reducing the incident wave energy by building a detached low-crested breakwater or by sand nourishment.

398,WOS:000394257200009,"In the United States, the City of Gainesville in Florida was the pioneer in the implementation of a long-term feed-in-tariff model to purchase solar electricity generated by privately owned systems located in the public utility's service territory, accelerating the investments in renewable energy. Based on the German model, the city implemented the feed-in-tariff program using 20-year agreements with suppliers. This program is funded by the electricity ratepayers through an increment in the electricity bill. A flat purchase rate is calculated using solar electric system costs and varies based on the type and size of installation. This cost-based purchase rate ensures a safe return margin to investors and is reduced annually for new contracts as market installation costs go down to promote the technology development in the region and encourage investors to act. Gainesville adopted this renewable energy policy in 2009 to diversify its generation portfolio, respond to community demands and meet carbon reduction goals, and discovered in this program a tool to expand distributed renewable generation, help reduce carbon emissions in the city. The program provided a rise from near 300kW of solar energy installed capacity in 2008 to approximately 20.5MW by April of 2014 (18.55MW through FIT and 1.99MW through net metering), and this deployment of more than 260 installations created a solar market in the region and contributed to sustained construction and solar employment through a difficult economy. This significant success in the adopted scheme turned Gainesville into a global leader in solar energy installed capacity per capita, surpassing more mature markets such as the state of California. Using some lessons learned from Gainesville's experience and from dozens of nations across the world, similar feed-in-tariff programs have been adopted in larger municipal utility markets and some states. Also known as CLEAN in some U.S. jurisdictions (Clean Local Energy Accessible Now), municipal utilities including Palo Alto, Sacramento, Ft. Collins, Long Island Power Authority, and Los Angeles have similar programs, as does the State of Vermont.

399,WOS:000307196000117,"Due to its high thermal performance, ground source heat pump systems (GSHPs) have been introduced as an alternative to reduce energy consumption of heating and cooling systems. The thermal performance of GSHPs strongly depends on ground temperature and energy demand for heating and cooling during the year. Certainly, increasing the global temperature means warmer ground. On the other hand, the thermal load of a building is influenced by thermal quality of building envelop (TQBE) and also influenced by the ambient air temperature. There is absolutely no doubt that the global temperature has increased during the last century. Over time, the buildings designs are changing. These result in changed thermal load of the buildings, ground temperature, and thereby changed the thermal performance of GSHPs. The objective of current work was to investigate the impact of TQBE under different global warming scenarios on driving energy and construction cost of GSHPs in Vienna. This was achieved by comparing the driving energy of the GSHP as well the required total length of the borehole heat exchanger for different GW scenarios and different TQBE. Under climate conditions of Vienna city study shows that improving the TQBE and increasing ambient air temperature result in reduced driving energy of GSHP. While is it not obvious for the required total borehole depth. Namely, after a certain degree of GW, increasing TQBE might result in increased required borehole depth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

400,WOS:000392831500007,"Alongside COP 21 in Paris, nearly 400 city mayors pledged to reduce urban greenhouse gas emissions, in some cases by dramatic amounts. As part of these pledges, mayors committed to count and track their emissions using a particular approach, the Global Protocol for Community-scale GHG emissions (GPC). The GPC, and most other, prior community-scale protocols like it, evolved from IPCC-based GHG accounting rules developed at the national scale, and where principles such as completeness, comparability and accuracy are paramount. At a local scale, however, different principles - namely, relevance - may become more important, given the different focus and governance structures of city governments. Here, we propose improvements to local-scale GHG accounting approaches, including the GPC, that would delineate categories of emissions sources and activities over which local policymakers have more or less influence. For many cities, a primary, or ""core"" category of emissions could be devoted to CO2 from buildings and passenger transport, and CH4 from waste management. We argue that simplifying and focusing city-scale GHG accounting on these sources would improve the policy-relevance of city-scale GHG accounting and make it easier for cities to play effective roles in the global mobilization to limit warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees C.","Erickson, P, Morgenstern, T",1,Paris,FRA,10.1080/17583004.2016.1238743,SRID=4326;POINT (2.3488 48.85341),2138551,Fixing greenhouse gas accounting at the city scale,2016
401,WOS:000166139100037,"The use of anaerobic lagoons as the first pond in waste stabilization pond systems in tropical and warm-temperature climates is considered a highly cost-effective and practical way to treat municipal wastewater. These anaerobic ponds, designed with hydraulic residence times of up to six days, can effect BOD5 removals of 60 to 80%. The subsequent aerobic stabilization pond surface area is greatly reduced over systems designed without anaerobic treatment up front due to the organic load reduction occurring anaerobically. in lagoon systems with mechanical aeration, operation costs can be greatly reduced. While odour is a concern with anaerobic treatment, anaerobic ponds treating municipal wastewater can be designed to be relatively odour-free given sufficiently low wastewater sulfate concentrations. However, when sulfate concentrations are high, or when odour control or greenhouse gas emissions are significant issues, or when the wastewater is relatively high in organic strength resulting in commercial production of methane gas, anaerobic lagoons can be covered, and the biogas collected and burned both to produce energy and reduce emissions and odour. The City of Melbourne treats approximately 50% of its municipal wastewater at the Western Treatment Plant in waste stabilization ponds designed with anaerobic ponds as the first pond in the system. Each of three pond systems at the Western Treatment Plant receives an average dry weather flow of 120,000 m(3)/d with an average strength of 400 mg/L BOD5.

Reduction in water leakage in distribution networks as well as the associated energy saving and environmental impacts have recently received increased attention by scientists and water industries. Pressure management has been proposed as a cost-effective approach for reduction in water leakage. This study conducted a real-world water pressure regulation experiment to establish the pressure-leakage relationship in a district metering area (DMA) of the water distribution network in Beijing, China. Results showed that flow into the DMA was sensitive to inlet water pressure. A 5.6 m reduction in inlet pressure (from 38.8 m to 33.2 m) led to an 83 % reduction (12.1 l/s) in minimal night flow, which is a good approximator of leakage. These reductions resulted in 62,633 m(3) of water saved every year for every km pipe, as well as associated savings of 1.1 x 10(6) MJ of energy and 68 t of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions.

The Municipality of Genoa, Italy, joined the initiative on February 2009 and its Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), aimed at a 23.7% CO2 reduction by 2020, has been the first among European cities to be officially published by the European Commission. Following a description of EU environmental policies concerning the energy sector and related regulatory framework, this paper presents issues of CoM and SEAP from an overall standpoint and their application in the city of Genoa. The SEAP approach and criteria, initially considered at a general level, are then analyzed in detail with their operational consequences regarding the city. The Baseline Emission Inventory for the city, preparation of the SEAP, its implementation in the various sectors involved (buildings, renewable energy sources, transport, public policy, and others) are analyzed. Eventually, the SEAP monitoring strategy is addressed, considering assessment of the implemented actions, biennial monitoring report, and dynamic management of the CoM. In this way, a useful benchmark is provided to those facing this issue and, more generally, to those dealing with the management of energy sustainability at various levels.

Additionally, the analysis of contrasted paths towards exiting fossil fuel followed by two 'pilot' cities (Hanover and Vaxjo), the conditions of their success and limitations encountered, highlights another component of this multilevel character: the weight of national or federal support for local climate action and of influence between political actions performed at different levels, which appear to broaden the scope of urban energy transitions.","Emelianoff, C",9,Hannover,DEU,10.1177/0042098013500087,SRID=4326;POINT (9.733219999999999 52.37052),515140,"Local Energy Transition and Multilevel Climate Governance: The Contrasted Experiences of Two Pioneer Cities (Hanover, Germany, and Vaxjo, Sweden)",2014

407,WOS:000326082100008,"Modelling the design and implementation of urban water infrastructure (particularly decentralised systems) for strategic planning and policymaking requires detailed information of the spatial environment and quantitative knowledge of social preferences. Currently available models, however, mostly use land use, population and impervious cover data without much regard for detailed urban form or society. This study develops an algorithm for determining urban form from minimal spatial data input by incorporating local planning regulations. The interaction between urban form and implementation of lot-scale infiltration systems under different social, biophysical and climate constraints is then investigated, firstly by looking at how this varies in different residential land uses and subsequently in a case study of a typical Melbourne residential subdivision of mixed land uses. Feasibility of infiltration and its downstream impact (runoff volume, frequency and pollution) were assessed for a range of social preferences (quantified as allowable garden space) and climate scenarios (30 % increase/decrease in rainfall and evapotranspiration). Performance indicators were determined through long-term simulation with the MUSIC software. Results show how different biophysical, planning, social and climate conditions affect infiltration feasibility as well as system performance. High infiltrating soils, for example, allow smaller, well-performing and socially less-imposing systems. Low infiltrating soils lead to larger system sizes, occupy much of the allotment's garden space, but nevertheless provide the benefit of runoff frequency reduction. Overall, climate impact was not significant except for areas with poorly infiltrating soils. Joint consideration of social, planning, climate and water management aspects potentially allows more efficient policymaking, as an array of system configurations can be tested against different multi-faceted scenarios. Such models can help facilitate better participatory planning and policymaking.","Bach, PM, Deletic, A, Urich, C, Sitzenfrei, R, Kleidorfer, M, Rauch, W, McCarthy, DT",12,Melbourne,AUS,10.1007/s11269-013-0442-9,SRID=4326;POINT (144.96332 -37.814),4246375,Modelling Interactions Between Lot-Scale Decentralised Water Infrastructure and Urban Form - a Case Study on Infiltration Systems,2013

411,WOS:000345725400074,"Liquid desiccant air-conditioning (LDAC) system, which consists of a liquid desiccant ventilation system for dehumidification and an air-handling unit for cooling, has become a promising alternative for conventional technology. To evaluate its feasibility and applicability, the simulation of solar-assisted LDAC (SLDAC) in commercial buildings in five cities of four main climate regions were conducted, including Singapore in Tropical, Houston and Beijing in Temperate, Boulder in Arid and Los Angeles in Mediterranean. Results showed that the system's performance was seriously affected by the ratios of building's sensible and latent cooling load. For buildings located in humid areas with low sensible-total heat ratio (SHR), the electricity energy reduction of SLDAC was high, about 450 MW h in Houston and Singapore, which accounted for 40% of the total energy consumption in cooling seasons. The cost payback period was as short as approximately 7 years. The main reason is that the energy required for handling the moisture could be saved by liquid desiccant dehumidification, and the regeneration heat could be covered by solar collectors. For buildings in dry climate with high SHR, the total cooling load was low, but up to 45% electricity of AC system could be saved in Boulder because the chiller COP could be significantly improved during more than 70% operation time. The cost payback period was around 22 years, which was acceptable. However, for the buildings with mild SHR, such as those in Beijing and Los Angeles, the application of SLDAC was not that suitable, in which the electricity energy saved only around 100 MW h and the cost payback period was more than 30 years. The minimum installation area of solar collector should also be fulfilled, or the system would even consume more energy than the conventional ones. It can be concluded that the SLDAC performed best in humid areas and worst in locations with the mild outdoor humidity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

417,WOS:000314174800014,"BACKGROUND: As urban populations increase so does the amount of food transported to cities worldwide, and innovative agro-urban systems are being developed to integrate agricultural production into buildings; for example, by using roof top greenhouses (RTGs). This paper aims to quantify and compare, through a life cycle assessment, the environmental impact of the current linear supply system with a RTG system by using a case study for the production of tomatoes. RESULTS: The main results indicate that a change from the current linear system to the RTG system could result in a reduction, per kilogram of tomatoes (the functional unit), in the range of 44.4-75.5% for the different impact categories analysed, and savings of up to 73.5% in energy requirements. These savings are associated with re-utilisation of packaging systems (55.4-85.2%), minimisation of transport requirements (7.6-15.6%) and reduction of the loss of product during transportation and retail stages (7.3-37%). CONCLUSIONS: The RTG may become a strategic factor in the design of low-carbon cities in Mediterranean areas. Short-term implementation in the city of Barcelona could result in savings of 66.1 tonnes of CO2 eq. ha(-1) when considering the global warming potential, and of 71.03 t ha(-1) when considering that the transformation from woodland to agricultural land is avoided.

418,WOS:000374617200012,"The urbanization process leads many urban areas and megacities to be densely built and to overcome their physical and operational limits; in several cases, urban population density is growing faster than their infrastructures. Considering land use constraints, for mitigating some disagreeable living conditions and for creating new population opportunities, city planners have different opportunities involving the two opposite vertical directions: upward, erecting higher buildings or downward, developing a more intense use of the underground space. Both directions are characterized by positive and negative aspects and require suitable local condition to be built. In this paper, main issues related to the urban underground planning procedures are highlighted, taking also in consideration that after some very old visionary approaches, no relevant debates and concrete results have been further developed. Several underground-related technicalities are described and analyzed, mainly at sectorial level (f.i. mass transport systems, infrastructures for energy and water supply, storage facilities) however, experiences of a global urban planning - involving a holistic approach inside a City Master Plan - are still very few (Helsinki). A collection of some best practices is reviewed in this paper. Particular emphasis is devoted to the integrated planning approach and the related tools for the subsurface space assessment: the role of different planning tools for the rational use of the underground space in urban areas is analyzed and a variety of planning levels are discussed, from the more general one - the Master Plan - to the more sectorial ones. Moreover, the more recent visions for future cities - Smart, Resilient, Low-carbon and Post-Carbon Cities - are producing relevant and very useful technical and management solutions and the role of Integrated Mater Plans in this transition is further discussed.

Taking a commonly accepted, conventional bioclimatic housing model as a starting point, this study analyses the effect of passive systems of energy usage (based on orientation, shape and materials) in the transfer of heat across all facades between the microclimatic conditions outside the house and the interior of the house, thereby affecting internal comfort conditions. An optimised bioclimatic model which achieves a greater reduction in energy consumption has been established through the manipulation of these elements. The study, which uses the typology of the single-family house, was carried out in the municipality of Estepona, taken as a model city with respect to the process of urban consolidation within the Mediterranean enclave in the south of Spain. The analysis demonstrates that the optimised housing model significantly improves the daily thermal performance of the house as well as heating and cooling loads. Therefore, the adaptation of architecture to microclimatic conditions may be used as a basic strategy in the design and construction of more efficient housing.",,3,Estepona,ESP,10.1007/s12053-015-9383-x,SRID=4326;POINT (-5.14589 36.42764),65592,The influence of microclimate on architectural projects: a bioclimatic analysis of the single-family detached house in Spain's Mediterranean climate,2016

Ozone is the air pollutant most consistently projected to increase under future climate change. Purpose: To project future pediatric asthma emergency department visits associated with ground-level ozone changes, comparing 1990s to 2020s. Methods: This study assessed future numbers of asthma emergency department visits for children aged 0-17 years using (1) baseline New York City metropolitan area emergency department rates; (2) a dose-response relationship between ozone levels and pediatric asthma emergency department visits; and (3) projected daily 8-hour maximum ozone concentrations for the 2020s as simulated by a global-to-regional climate change and atmospheric chemistry model. Sensitivity analyses included population projections and ozone precursor changes. This analysis occurred in 2010. Results: In this model, climate change could cause an increase in regional summer ozone-related asthma emergency department visits for children aged 0-17 years of 7.3% across the New York City metropolitan region by the 2020s. This effect diminished with inclusion of ozone precursor changes. When population growth is included, the projections of morbidity related to ozone are even larger. Conclusions: The results of this analysis demonstrate that the use of regional climate and atmospheric chemistry models make possible the projection of local climate change health effects for specific age groups and specific disease outcomes, such as emergency department visits for asthma. Efforts should be made to improve on this type of modeling to inform local and wider-scale climate change mitigation and adaptation policy.

In this paper, we first develop an urban passenger transport energy saving and emission reduction potential evaluation model using the ""Long Range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP)"" tool; and then take Tianjin city as an empirical case to evaluate the reduction potential of final energy consumption, GHG emissions and pollutants emissions of Tianjin's urban passenger transport sector between 2010 and 2040 under four scenarios, i.e. BAU (business as usual) scenario, PP (the 12th five-year plan policy) scenario, CP (comprehensive policy) scenario and HP (hybrid policy of PP and CP) scenario. The results show that due to the public transport promotion, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in 2040 can be reduced by 22% and 22.6% in the PP scenario, compared to BAU. The largest reductions in energy consumption, CO2 and atmospheric pollutants emissions can be achieved under CP scenario, in which vehicle population regulation is the most effective to be implemented. Emissions standard regulation is the most effective measure to reduce atmospheric pollutant emissions in all the scenarios and green energy promotion is especially effective to reduce NOx and PM.

A WAIS collapse could cause a 5-6 metre global sea level rise within centuries. In three case studies, we investigate the response of society to the most extreme yet not implausible scenario, a five-metre sea level rise within a century, starting in 2030. The case studies combine a series of interviews with experts and stakeholders with a gaming workshop. In the Rhone delta, the most likely option would be retreat, with economic losses, perhaps social losses, and maybe ecological gains. In the Thames estuary, the probable outcome is less clear, but would probably be a mix of protection, accommodation and retreat, with parts of the city centre turned into a Venice of London. A massive downstream barrier is an alternative response. In the Rhine delta (the Netherlands), the initial response would be protection, followed by retreat from the economically less important parts of the country and, probably, from Amsterdam Rotterdam metropolitan region as well.

429,WOS:000325237700004,"Strong economic growth in China has fueled development of cities where increase in energy demand and transportation lead to severe air pollution. The cities contribute also a significant share of the national greenhouse gas emissions. We identify strong synergies between air quality and climate relevant measures that would allow improving cost-efficiency of air pollution policies. In order to help local policy makers to identify viable and efficient solutions, we developed a city-scale emission model (GAINS-City) based on the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, Austria). The GAINS-City model relies on a technology-based approach to evaluate the co-benefits of various policies. This approach allows for estimation of emission reductions of several pollutants (including SO2, NOx, PM) and CO2 for individual policies and support evaluation of co-benefits. In addition, a reduction index, an integrated rank of the individual reductions potential, was defined to recommend the priority of policies implementation. The approach will have great potential to be applied in many large cities with local input data and/or minor structure modifications. We conducted a case study in Beijing to demonstrate the model features. Based on the technology-based evaluation approach, policy packages were designed and implemented in policy scenarios. The emissions under three scenarios (Baseline, Air Quality, and Strict Air Quality) in base year (2005) and future years (2020 and 2030) were estimated. The results indicate a significant reduction potential. In 2030, implementation of Air Quality and Strict Air Quality scenarios could result in reductions of 39-48% of SO2 emissions, 38-42% of NOx emissions, 37-55% of PM2,5 emissions and 5-22% of CO2 emissions respectively, compared with the Baseline scenario. The results demonstrated air quality policies and measures could also have co-benefits of reducing CO2 emissions. However, there is no significant difference of reductions between the two policy scenarios, which indicates the limited further reduction potential in the stricter air quality case. This calls for a wider application of cleaner technologies, such as IGCC and CCS, and more aggressive air quality measures by neighboring provinces to control regional air pollution.

Shortfalls are intensified in arid and semi-arid regions under climate change through reduced and highly variable rainfall and greater frequency of droughts. Water planners are increasingly considering investments in capital infrastructure to enhance water security. Augmentation involves high capital sunk costs, and a typical challenge that arises is the need to determine whether or not, and at what scale, to invest in augmentation. Water planners face a risk of over-and under-investing in augmentation, but assessments that represent the tradeoffs involved in making augmentation decisions accurately and comprehensively are scarce. The analytical framework presented in this paper, looks retrospectively at what the insurance value of a seawater desalination plant in Adelaide would have been, had the investment been a decade earlier than it was, to illustrate assessing the risk of over- or under-investing in augmentation. The framework draws from three concepts: benefit cost analysis (BCA), probability theory, and conditional value at risk (CVaR). Results show that, at best, had the desalinisation plant been operational during the recent millennium drought, from 1998 to 2010, potential net annual cost of up to a maximum of A$170.6 m in extreme shortfall years, would have been avoided, but this would have involved incurring annual cost of up to A$149.0 m in years of no shortfalls.","Kandulu, J",2,Adelaide,AUS,10.2166/ws.2013.045,SRID=4326;POINT (138.59863 -34.92866),1225235,Are we risking too much?

The evaluation of the environmental impacts of the energy lifecycle can contribute to decision making regarding energy management. In this paper, the lifecycle assessment (LCA) method is introduced to calculate the environmental impact loads of different types of energy resources (including coal, oil, natural gas, and electricity) used in urban regions. The scope of LCA includes the production, transportation, and consumption processes. The pollutant emission inventory is listed, and the environmental impact loads are acquired through the calculation of environmental impact potentials, normalization, and weighted assessment. The evaluation method is applied to Beijing, China, revealing that photochemical oxidant formation and acidification are the primary impact factors in the lifecycle of all energy resources and that the total environmental impact load increased steadily from 132.69 million person equivalents (PE) in 1996 to 208.97 million PE in 2010. Among the energy types, coal contributes most to the environmental impact, while the impacts caused by oil, natural gas, and electricity have been growing.

438,WOS:000356194300019,"Policy integration between autonomous policy sectors is a tool for managing interdependent technical systems to avoid suboptimization. Biogas, regarded as a renewable energy carrier usable in the energy and transport systems, is produced from organic material such as municipal organic waste (MOW). It is connected to a number of systems and policy sectors, making biogas management an instructive case for studying policy integration processes. Swedish biogas production has increased in recent years, and in the Stockholm region there has been enormous interest in biogas production for vehicle use since the early 2000s. In this paper biogas will be discussed in the perspective that it is or has potential to be a vital part of three systems: waste, energy, and transportation. The aim is to analyse whether policy integration occurs between the systems and to explore if boundary objects can play a role when understanding policy integration processes. In examining the biogas development process, regional policy documents and interviews with stakeholders in the biogas process are used. The results indicate consensus among regional actors that biogas should be used in vehicles and that MOW should be collected for this purpose, indicating congruence of understanding of biogas. Biogas functions as a boundary object in these cases and contributes to high policy integration between the energy and waste systems. Despite consensus that biogas should be used in the transport system, there is little policy integration between the energy and transport sectors. The policy sectors of transport infrastructure and spatial planning are not concerned with fuel or biogas issues. Public transport policy focuses on the use of biogas for their vehicles, but even if biogas serves as a boundary object it is not developing into policy integration processes. The conclusion is that biogas development has resulted in integrated policymaking between the energy and waste sectors and biogas has served as a strong boundary object which has spurred that development. Between the energy and transport sectors there is little policy integration, and biogas is not a boundary object in the cases of transport infrastructure and spatial planning policy sectors. What this case shows is that if there is a lack of presence of a boundary object it suggests no preconditions for policy integration processes to start. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

439,WOS:000300951000019,"With projected increases in population and urbanisation in Australia, the sustainable supply of water and energy over the medium to long term will be an important challenge. In this context, meeting a part of the growing demand for urban water may involve reliance upon desalinated water in the future. Moreover, the feasibility and viability of renewable energy sources for water desalination will be of policy importance, particularly in a potentially low carbon Australian economy. In this article, we analyse the potential applicability of solar and wind energy to provide power for water desalination. In two illustrative examples, we assess the feasibility of supplying 3% of Sydney's projected total water consumption (supplied at an average rate of 24.7 Gl/yr) and 5% of Sydney's projected water consumption (supplied at an average rate of 32.7 Gl/yr) over a 15-yr period (2011-2025) using a photovoltaic (PV) solar powered (130 MW) and a hybrid (PV solar and wind energy) powered (205 MW) reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants, respectively. In addition to supplying cleaner energy, the renewable energy sources considered in this article have additional cost advantages in the presence of a carbon penalty. For example, at hypothetical carbon penalty rates of $20/tCO(2) and $30/tCO(2), the estimated cost savings-in net present value (NPV) terms assuming a discount rate of 4.2%-of the PV solar (hybrid) plant will amount to around be $18.7m ($25.2 m) and $28.0m ($37.9m), respectively, over the 15-yr period, relative to a situation where the desalination plant is instead being powered by black coal. Under a discount rate of 8.4%, the cost savings of the PV solar (hybrid) plant associated with carbon penalty rates of $20/tCO(2) and $30/tCO(2) are estimated to be around $12.8m ($17.6 m) and $19.2m ($26.4m), respectively, in NPV terms. Our analysis also shows that in addition to providing the required power supply for the illustrative desalination plants, the renewable energy supply sources analysed here would produce excess electricity that could be sold to a nearby grid. Consequently, assuming a wholesale electricity price of $36.74/MWh, the PV solar plant and the hybrid renewable plant are estimated to have the capacity to earn around $63.9 million and $110.0 million in NPV terms, respectively, over the 15-yr period, through excess electricity sales. Under a discount rate of 8.4%, the value of the excess electricity sales of the PV solar plant and the hybrid renewable plant are estimated to be around $54.5 million and $91.7 million, respectively, in NPV terms.

440,WOS:000309332800005,"Passive design, which has strong dependency of climate and areas, is the most economical effective strategy for reducing energy consumption inside residential buildings. A total of 25 representative cities of China were selected for optimum analysis. This paper presents an approach in which the orthogonal method and the listing method are integrated to explore how energy consumption is minimized in residential buildings by optimizing 7 passive design measures for each city: wall thickness (WT), roof insulation thickness (RIT), external wall insulation thickness (EWIT), window orientation (WO), window-wall ratio (WWR), glazing type (GT), and sunroom depth/overhang depth (SD/OD). With the optimization, the passive design could reduce annual thermal load of building considerably, even could replace air-condition systems in winter for the areas with high solar radiation such as Lhasa. The results reveal that neighbor cities have the same optimal combinations and the similar effects of energy-saving measures. A total of 7 passive design zones were summarized in a map. The architect could be guided in his choice of appropriate passive measures directly from the map or handling of exact passive design by the optimal approach proposed in this paper for different areas in China.

Based on site surveys and expert interviews in these pilot cities, this research conducted a comparative analysis on incentive policies of local city level. The analysis results show that policy designs of existing commercial buildings should be further improved. The aspects that influence the implementation effect in the future, such as subsidy level, installments, and business model promotion, should be specified in the policy clauses. Referring to the technical solution and cost-benefit in Chongqing, we found that lighting system is the most common retrofit objects while envelope system is the least common one.

Shanghai, China has been a leader in this planning approach. Shanghai's experience can be valuable for other cities facing similar pressures of urbanization, suburbanization, and motorization while striving to improve livability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To gain useful insights from Shanghai, a travel survey of residents in a recently developed suburban metro station area was conducted to examine how the city's mass rapid transit (MRT) has influenced residents' travel and car ownership. With statistical methods, including logistic regression, it was found that (a) MRT was generally adequate in supporting the station area's economic relationships with the central city and local employment locations; (b) a high percentage of residents intended to commute by the MRT when they moved to the suburban station area, and their original intention positively influenced their current travel and car ownership; and (c) rail transit may help temporarily reduce the pace of motorization in households near suburban metro stations by delaying a car purchase and lowering the probability of car use in commuting. However, it was also found that car ownership had been increasing quite rapidly despite the positive effects of a much expanded and improved metro system, and that once a person owned a car, he or she would most likely drive to work.","Pan, HX, Shen, Q, Zhao, T",6,Shanghai,CHN,10.3141/2394-08,SRID=4326;POINT (121.45806 31.22222),22315474,"Travel and Car Ownership of Residents near New Suburban Metro Stations in Shanghai, China",2013

A negative binomial regression model was used to analyse monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall and the monthly count of cryptosporidiosis notifications. In the metropolitan area, a 1 degrees C increase in monthly average minimum temperature of the current month was associated with a 22% increase in cryptosporidiosis notifications (incident rate ratio (IRR) 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.31).

Rainfall was not associated with notifications in either area. These relationships should be considered when planning public health response to ecological risks as well as when developing policies involving climate change.

This behavior, heavily influenced by the informal advice of investment bankers, seemed to many observers to confirm the oft-decried tendency of debt-issuing public authorities to sacrifice their accountability to citizens in order to please the bankers and other debt-market participants on whom they depend for financial resources. Yet the MTA's choice appears on closer examination to have fulfilled the common desires of contemporary fare payers, tax payers, voters, and elected officials to maximize current spending while deferring costs to future tax and fare payers. The MTA case highlights potential conflicts between the professional imperative of democratic accountability and the competing professional norms of cost minimization, sustainability, and intergenerational equity. The fundamental structure of this dilemma is also apparent in other policy arenas with intergenerational implications, such as social security and climate policy, and raises the question of when obedience to market, political, and hierarchical expectations can justify sacrificing professional principles.","Justice, JB, Miller, GJ",5,New York City,USA,10.1177/0275074010377110,SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),8175133,Accountability and Debt Management: The Case of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority,2011
445,WOS:000378079900001,"Residential buildings play an important role in consumption of energy resources. About 40 % of all primary energy is used in buildings all over the world. This paper is the second part of the study on the life-cycle energy (LCEA), emissions (LCCO(2)A) and cost (LCCA) assessment of two residential buildings constructed in urban and rural areas. In the first part, the methodology, formulations and procedure for such a comprehensive analysis are provided, while this paper provides an application of the methodology that considers two actual buildings located in Gaziantep, Turkey. The proposed model focused on building construction, operation and demolition phases to estimate energy use, carbon emissions and costs per square meter over a 50-year lifespan. The optimum thickness of insulation used to reduce energy consumption and emissions per square meter is determined. It is found that the operating phase is dominant in both urban and rural residential buildings and contributes 87-85 % of the primary energy requirements and 88-82 % of CO2 emissions, respectively. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions were 5.8 and 3.9 tons CO2 eqv. for BT1 and BT2, respectively. It is calculated that the life-cycle energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the residential buildings can be reduced by up to 22.8 and 23.4 %, respectively, by using a proper insulation material for the external walls. The life-cycle cost, consisting of mortgage, energy, maintenance, service and demolition payments are calculated to be 7.28 and 1.72 million USD for BT1 and BT2, respectively. Building envelope developments, such as better wall insulation, provide noteworthy potential energy savings and contribute to the reductions from cooling and space heating. Therefore, primary strategies and technologies needed for efficient buildings include optimal insulation of external walls. The economic insulation thickness of the residential buildings in Gaziantep is determined to be 80 mm by using a life-cycle cost analysis. The results show that because of the differences in building structures and living standards, life-cycle energy intensity and CO2 emissions in urban residential buildings are 29 and 25 % higher than in rural conditions.","Atmaca, A",2,Gaziantep,TUR,10.1007/s11367-016-1051-7,SRID=4326;POINT (37.3825 37.05944),1065975,Life-cycle assessment and cost analysis of residential buildings in South East of Turkey: part 2-a case study,2016

It is widely accepted that the use of timber may be able to reduce the embodied energy of a building. However, the development of timber buildings in China is not as rapid as in some other countries. This may be because of the limitations of building regulations and technological development. Several new policies have been or are being implemented in China in order to encourage the use of timber in building construction and this could lead to a revolutionary change in the building industry in China. This paper is the first one to examine the feasibility of using Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) as an alternative solution to concrete by means of a cradle-to-grave life-cycle assessment in China. A seven-storey reference concrete building in Xi'an was selected as a case study in comparison with a redesigned CLT building. Two cities in China, in cold and severe cold regions (Xi'an and Harbin), were selected for this research. The assessment includes three different stages of the life span of a building: materialisation, operation, and end-of-life. The inventory data used in the materialisation stage was mostly local, in order to ensure that the assessment appropriately reflects the situation in China. Energy consumption in the operation stage was obtained from simulation by commercialised software IES (TM), and different scenarios for recycling of timber material in the end-of-life are discussed in this paper. The results from this paper show that using CLT to replace conventional carbon intensive material would reduce energy consumption by more than 30% and reduce CO2 emission by more than 40% in both cities.

The elastic-perfectly plastic material behaviour was assumed for the main structure, with linear TMDs employed by virtue of their simplicity and robustness. The accumulated hysteretic energy dissipation affected by TMD was examined, and the ratio of the hysteretic energy absorption in the structure with TMD to that without it is proposed to be used, in conjunction with the peak displacement ratio, as a supplementary TMD performance index since it gives an indication of the accumulated damage induced in the inelastic structures. For the ground motions considered, TMD would be effective in reducing the hysteretic energy absorption demand in the critical storeys for buildings in the 1.8-2.8 s range. The consequence is reduction in damage of the buildings which would otherwise suffer heavy damage in the absence of TMD, resulting in economical restorability in the damage control limit state.

449,WOS:000424727100034,"With China's rapid urbanization and industrialization, carbon emission in Chinese cities deserve special attention, and promoting low-carbon city (LCC) is considered essential for China. However, different cities present different development stages and carbon emission scenarios. This study presents the factors affecting carbon emission by introducing a city development-stage framework. The method of logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) is adopted to decompose emission factors into energy structure, energy intensity, industrial structure, economic output and population scale. Beijing is chosen as the case city in this study, and four development stages for the city are identified by using the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory, namely, S-1 (-1991), S-2 (1991-2004), S-3 (2004-2022) and S-4 (2022-). As the data collected for analysis are only available for the period of 1995-2014, this study focuses on the factor analysis for the stage S-2 and S-3. The results show that the main driving factor for carbon emission increase in the stage S-2 is economic output, followed by population scale, while the main factor contributes to carbon emission reduction in this stage is the industrial structure. In the stage S-3, the economic output is the top contributor to increase carbon emission, followed by population scale and energy structure, whereas energy intensity is the main influencing factor in curbing the carbon emission. Although the paper refers to the specific case of Beijing, the understanding on the driving emission factors in different development stages not only provides policy-makers and practitioners with valuable references for adopting effective measures to reduce carbon emission, but also provides other cities internationally with important lessons for accelerating the development of LCC. The innovative economic development stage framework incorporates carbon emission characteristics provides a new approach for understanding driving emission factors at city or national level.

The model is examined using partial least square regression. Results show that urbanization level, economic level and industry proportion positively influence the CO2 emissions, while tertiary industry proportion, energy intensity and R&D output negatively do. Urbanization level is the main driving factor of CO2 emissions, and tertiary industry proportion is the main inhibiting factor. In addition, along with the growth of per capita GDP, the increase of CO2 emissions does not follow the Environmental Kuznets Curve model. Based on these empirical findings and the specific circumstances of Beijing, we provide some policy recommendations on how to reduce carbon intensity. Beijing should pay more attention to tertiary industry and residential energy consumption for carbon emission reduction. It is necessary to establish a comprehensive evaluation index of social development.

454,WOS:000342180000004,"Climate change is projected to affect Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of increased temperatures and changed rainfall patterns. The impacts of climate change are expected to be unevenly distributed throughout the region, due to differences in geographic location, demographic pressures, levels of poverty, and natural resource dependence. To date, few studies have explored these impacts and the governmental responses to cope with them at a city scale. This article examines the challenges faced by the Mexico City government as it translates the federal climate change policy into successful mitigation and adaptation. It analyzes climate change impacts on Mexico and Mexico City (also known as the Federal District), the federal and city's mitigation and adaptation responses, and advances and contradictions in the implementation of these strategies at the national and city levels. Similar problems have limited the effectiveness of these actions at both the federal and city levels, including the overexploitation of natural resources, a lack of climate information and monitoring systems, and the subordination of climate change strategies to the objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. These problems have resulted in poor coordination and collaboration among various levels of government to cope with climate change, in addition to avoiding local capacity building, particularly in regard to forest conservation.","Sosa-Rodriguez, FS",4,Mexico City,MEX,10.1007/s11027-013-9455-1,SRID=4326;POINT (-99.12766000000001 19.42847),12294193,From federal to city mitigation and adaptation: climate change policy in Mexico City,2014

After the vital step of emissions quantification, strategies must be developed to detail how emissions reductions targets will be achieved. The Pathways to Urban Reductions in Greenhouse Gas Emissions (PURGE) model allows the estimation of emissions from four pertinent urban sectors: electricity generation, buildings, private transportation, and waste. Additionally, the carbon storage from urban and regional forests is modeled. An emissions scenario is examined for a case study of the greater Toronto, Ontario, Canada, area using data on current technology stocks and government projections for stock change. The scenario presented suggests that even with some aggressive targets for technological adoption (especially in the transportation sector), it will be difficult to achieve the less ambitious 2050 emissions reduction goals of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This is largely attributable to the long life of the building stock and limitations of current retrofit practices. Additionally, demand reduction (through transportation mode shifting and building occupant behavior) will be an important component of future emissions cuts.","Mohareb, E, Kennedy, C",9,Ontario; Toronto,USA; CAN,10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00563.x,SRID=4326;POINT (-117.65089 34.06334); SRID=4326;POINT (-79.41630000000001 43.70011),171214; 2600000,Greenhouse Gas Emission Scenario Modeling for Cities Using the PURGE Model A Case Study of the Greater Toronto Area,2012

This is specifically relevant in the UK's suburbs where 84% of the population reside. To assess this future impact and the effectiveness of adaptive retrofitting, probabilistic climate change data for the 2030s and 2050s are used to assess the overheating risk in six suburban house archetypes in three cities in the UK: Bristol, Oxford and Stockport. The risks of overheating in typical constructions are assessed and the possibility of preventing overheating through the use of adaptation packages is evaluated through dynamic thermal simulation. Homes in Oxford show the greatest risk of overheating. The most effective (passive) package for tackling future overheating tends to combine fabric improvements and internal heat gain reduction. To assist planners and policy-makers in assessing and preventing overheating risk at a stock level, this adaptation package is further evaluated in selected neighbourhoods across the three case study cities, using the geographical information system (GIS)-based DECoRuM-Adapt (Domestic Energy, Carbon Counting and Carbon Reduction Model) model.

The Fans Assessment Numeration System was used to measure the airflow rate. Temperature, relative humidity and power consumption were also monitored. Results show there were significant differences in the airflow rate between the fans with a cleaned and uncleaned guard screen (P<0.05). Power consumption also differed significantly even with the same cooling effect in greenhouse. When fan belts were adjusted to the proper tension, the fan speed and airflow rate were 13.1% and 30.1% higher than those of original belts, respectively. The daily average power consumption for the fan with the original loose belts was 20.4% higher than that with the adjusted belts when the pad was not working and 24.2% higher with pad working. The ventilation performance of fans with identical specifications showed a variation by up to 13.0% in terms of the ventilating efficiency ratio. These results demonstrated that fans should be cleaned routinely, and belt tension should be checked to ensure that fan performance meets specifications. This can reduce the power consumption in greenhouses for environmental control. Moreover, reordering fan staging, so that the most efficient fans are used in areas of greatest demand, can also reduce ventilation energy costs.",,3,Urbana,USA,10.3965/j.ijabe.20150801.014,SRID=4326;POINT (-88.20726999999999 40.11059),42311,Evaluation of ventilation performance and energy efficiency of greenhouse fans,2015
458,WOS:000298724400004,"Rust belt cities of the northeastern United States are plagued by flat or declining economies and the accompanying social fallout from lack of employment. Advocates of green fuels, green infrastructure and green jobs have proposed these nature-based technologies as means to revitalize the economies of cities. Before making public and private investment a baseline analysis of the relative magnitude of existing energy production and energy respiration at the neighborhood scale is useful in order to understand what the potential for green infrastructure might be. Because the urban canopy and other green infrastructure can enhance urban socio-ecological metabolism, we measured the flows of natural energy produced (P) by the urban forest versus the industrial or fossil energy currently consumed or respired (R) in three economically and demographically distinct neighborhoods of a typical rust-belt city, Syracuse, NY. Our objectives were to (1) understand the potential for green energy to replace fossil fuels in general, (2) assess the degree to which different socio-demographic communities are receiving the ecosystem benefits of existing urban ""green"" infrastructure (i.e. forest primary production), and (3) identify where local (in-city) biotic energy resources could be enhanced or fossil fuel consumption altered to improve overall urban socio-ecological metabolism. We found that (1) the fossil energy consumed in all three neighborhoods was 200-700 times higher than the biotic ""green"" energy produced: (2) that to produce this much energy from willow biomass grown in the region would require at least between 0.3 and 0.7 ha of bio-energy production per person depending on affluence, density of living, transportation mix and home fuel mix; (3) that although the more affluent neighborhood used, per residence and per person, almost twice as much energy as that of the downtown more densely settled and poorer neighborhood, its R:P ratio was still the lowest due to the high primary productivity of its neighborhood tree canopy. As a first assessment our findings identify several opportunities for enhancement of the socio-ecological metabolism of these neighborhoods, and the city at large, through conversion of heating units in poorer neighborhoods away from expensive electricity, and toward tree planting, solar installations, and per capita energy use reductions.

459,WOS:000413520200003,"To encourage low-carbon travel, reduce car trips, and improve the urban traffic system, an understanding of travel mode choice for escorting children to and from school is important. Previous studies have focused mostly on walking and bicycling. However, the electric bicycle (e-bike-a mainstream escorting mode in China) rarely has been investigated. The factors that affect travel mode choice (walking, e-bike, or car) for escorting children to and from school are explored at the household level in a case study from Kunming, China. Intrahousehold interactions and parental space-time constraints are represented by the comparative working hours of the parents and space-time coordination in joint parent-child trips, respectively. A multinomial logit model was applied in mode analysis. The results reveal interesting phenomena in travel mode choices for escorting children to school. When the mother's working hours are longer than the father's, the travel mode choice for escorting a child to and from school is less likely to be walking or e-bike; in other words, a car is the preferred choice in mother-dominated households. The distance deviation between parents and children is a significant factor in choosing between a car or an e-bike. Children are more likely to be escorted by e-bikes as a result of distance deviations, and walking or e-bike is less likely to be chosen when the school is far from home. Results could be valuable for traffic demand management to reduce car use for trips to and from school. In addition, e-bike development should be considered seriously for the future development of China.",,0,Kunming,CHN,10.3141/2634-02,SRID=4326;POINT (102.71833 25.03889),3855346,"Investigating Electric Bicycles as a Travel Mode Choice for Escorting Children to School A Case Study in Kunming, China",2017

The risks in Ontario - Canada's most populous province - include increasing temperatures, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, and alterations to precipitation regimes. Socio-economic-demographic patterns could magnify the implications climate change has for Ontario, including the presence of rapidly growing vulnerable populations, exacerbation of warming trends by heat-islands in large urban areas, and connectedness to global transportation networks. This study examines climate change adaptation in the public health sector in Ontario using information from interviews with government officials. Methods: Fifty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted, four with provincial and federal health officials and 49 with actors in public health and health relevant sectors at the municipal level. We identify adaptation efforts, barriers and opportunities for current and future intervention. Results: Results indicate recognition that climate change will affect the health of Ontarians. Health officials are concerned about how a changing climate could exacerbate existing health issues or create new health burdens, specifically extreme heat (71%), severe weather (68%) and poor air-quality (57%). Adaptation is currently taking the form of mainstreaming climate change into existing public health programs. While adaptive progress has relied on local leadership, federal support, political will, and inter-agency efforts, a lack of resources constrains the sustainability of long-term adaptation programs and the acquisition of data necessary to support effective policies. Conclusions: This study provides a snapshot of climate change adaptation and needs in the public health sector in Ontario. Public health departments will need to capitalize on opportunities to integrate climate change into policies and programs, while higher levels of government must improve efforts to support local adaptation and provide the capacity through which local adaptation can succeed.","Paterson, JA, Ford, JD, Ford, LB, Lesnikowski, A, Berry, P, Henderson, J, Heymann, J",9,Ontario,USA,10.1186/1471-2458-12-452,SRID=4326;POINT (-117.65089 34.06334),171214,Adaptation to climate change in the Ontario public health sector,2012
461,WOS:000296683400015,"China has been building approximately 1 GW of new coal-fired power plant per week since 2005. Power plants now in construction may continue to operate until 2040. ""CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) Ready"" enables and eases the subsequent retrofitting of a plant to be able to capture carbon dioxide later in that plant's lifetime. Building on the definitions of the IEA GHG (IEA Greenhouse Gas Programme) and GCCSI (Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute), this study suggests a novel concept 'CCS Ready Hub' for implementing CCS Ready. A CCS Ready Hub not only includes a number of new coal-fired power plants but also integrates other existing stationary carbon dioxide emissions sources into the planning for potential infrastructure. We conducted a case study of Guangdong province in China with a detailed engineering and economic assessment in Shenzhen City. The study first reviewed the potential storage sites and analysed the existing stationary emissions sources in Guangdong using a GIS (Geographic Information System) approach. Thereafter, we focused on investigating the economic benefits of a 'CCS Ready Hub' at a potential 4 GW new USCPC (ultra-supercritical pulverised coal-fired) power plant in Shenzhen. Using the cost of carbon dioxide avoidance in 2020 as a criterion, we found that the concept of a CCS Ready Hub to finance CCS Ready at a regional planning level rather than at an individual plant is preferred since it significantly reduces the overall cost of building an integrated CCS system to reduce carbon emissions in the future.

A desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to become more energy self-sufficient is driving this change. Theoretically, local level management is desirable because it achieves these goals through improvements in the three areas of energy efficiency, energy conservation and switching to renewable energy sources. The analysis of 10 of the first community energy plans in Canadian communities, ranging in population size from 500 to one million, finds that communities are choosing policies and programs centred on increasing energy efficiency and conservation while renewable energy receives much less attention. Municipal operations were called upon to set higher targets than the general community. Communities that recognized the substantial potential of renewable energy often focused on technologies that the municipal sector could implement, such as bio-fuels for their transportation fleet. Wind, passive solar design, solar photovoltaics and solar thermal options were only recommended in a few cases. Overall, only one of the five larger communities (Calgary) recommended implementing multiple renewable energy technologies while three of the five smaller communities proposed multiple renewable energy sources.

Regulating rapidly growing car-holdings of urban households, stabilizing population growth, and transiting residents' low-carbon awareness to household behavior in energy saving and other spheres of consumption in the context of rapid population aging and the growing middle income class are suggested as critical measures for carbon mitigation among urban households in the Yangtze River Delta.","Xu, XB, Tan, Y, Chen, S, Yang, GS, Su, WZ",7,Ningbo; Nanjing; Changzhou,CHN; CHN; CHN,10.1371/journal.pone.0121604,SRID=4326;POINT (121.54945 29.87819); SRID=4326;POINT (118.77778 32.06167); SRID=4326;POINT (119.95401 31.77359),3491597; 7165292; 949018,"Urban Household Carbon Emission and Contributing Factors in the Yangtze River Delta, China",2015
473,WOS:000381529300002,"A pilot project of the solar water heating system combined with a low temperature air source heat pump (ASHP) unit was established in 2014 in a detached residential house in the rural region of Beijing, in order to investigate the system application prospect for single family houses via system optimization design and economic analysis. The established system was comprised of the glass heat-pipe based evacuated tube solar collectors with a gross area of 18.8 m(2) and an ASHP with a stated heating power of 8 kW for the space heating of a single family rural house of 81.4 m(2). The dynamic thermal performance of the pilot system was measured for continuous 20 days under typical cold climate conditions and the test data was used to validate the TRNSYS simulation model established. On the basis of model validation, system optimizations of both the existing pilot household and the typical rural house with good building insulation were undertaken to figure out the system economical efficiency in the rural regions of Beijing. The results show that the payback periods of the solar space heating system combined with the ASHP with the collector areas 15.04-22.56 m(2) are 173-22.4 years for the established pilot household on the current electricity price level of 0.5 RMB/kWh, comparing with the reference condition of the fully ASHP space heating. It is further found that the equivalent solar heat price per kWh is too high under the current solar market cost price and collector technology. To put forward the integrated solar space heating for reducing carbon emission, it is suggested that the Beijing municipal government should offer some financial subsidy to compensate the equivalent solar heat price per kWh.

Saudi Building Code prescribes a fixed base temperature of 18.3 degrees C to estimate the heating degree-days and cooling degree-days. Using historical meteorological data (2005-2014), this article presents the heating degree-days and cooling degree-days estimated for the representative cities in all the five inhabited climatic zones of Saudi Arabia. We used the base temperatures of 14 degrees C, 16 degrees C and 18 degrees C for heating degree-days, and 18 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 28 degrees C for cooling degree-days for Dhahran, Guriat, Jeddah, Khamis Mushait and Riyadh cities. We developed multiple regression models for heating degree-days and cooling degree-days at various base temperatures for these zones. Degree-days for other cities in similar climates with limited input data can be computed with these. Lowering of base temperature by 2K from 18 degrees C reduced the heating degree-days by 33-65%. At 14 degrees C of base temperature, the heating requirement reduced by 60-95%. Elevating the base temperature by 2K from 18 degrees C lowered the cooling degree-days by 16-38%. At 28 degrees C of base temperature cooling can be completely eliminated in Khamis Mushait, and reduced by 65-92% in other cities. This observation merits rethinking about use of appropriate base temperatures that properly link the outdoor environment to reduce the energy consumption. Practical application: Using historical data, we developed regression models for predicting heating and cooling degree-days for five cities of Saudi Arabia in various climate zones without the historic data. Using these, we can estimate the changes in heating/cooling load due to the variation in base temperatures. For example, lowering base temperature by 2-4K from 18 degrees C reduces the HDDs by 33-95% and elevating the base temperature by 2-4K from 18 degrees C lowered the CDDs by 16-68%.",,1,Khamis Mushait; Jeddah; Dhahran; Riyadh,SAU; SAU; SAU; SAU,10.1177/0143624416681383,SRID=4326;POINT (42.73333 18.3); SRID=4326;POINT (39.19797 21.54238); SRID=4326;POINT (50.11396 26.28864); SRID=4326;POINT (46.72185 24.68773),387553; 2867446; 99540; 4205961,A method to estimate the heating and cooling degree-days for different climatic zones of Saudi Arabia,2017

Scattering coefficient (sigma(sct)) and absorption coefficient (sigma(abs)) are obtained from integrating Nephelometer and Aethalometer, respectively. Also, the single scattering albedo (omega(0)), Scattering/absorption Angstrom exponents were examined during the period of study. Diurnal variations of sigma(sct) and sigma(abs) show a bi-peak pattern with two maxima and one minimum in a day. The largest values of sigma(sct) and sigma(abs) are obtained in winter while the lowest values are measured in monsoon. From the measurements sigma(550)(sct) and sigma(550)(abs) are found to be 110 +/- 12.23 Mm(-1) and 33 +/- 5.2 Mm(-1), respectively during the study period. An analysis of the omega(0) suggests that there is a more absorbing fraction in the particle composition over the measurement site. The omega(0) obtained in the surface boundary layer of Anantapur is below the critical value of 0.86 that determines the shift from cooling to warming. A relationship between scattering/absorption coefficients and scattering/absorption Angstrom exponent and single scattering albedo is further examined. In order to understand the origins of the air masses in the study region, we performed seven-day back trajectory analyses based on the NOAA HYSPLIT model. These trajectories were computed at several altitudes (3000 m, 1500 m, and 500 m) for June 2012 and May 2013.

We construct a dataset consisting of participant and non-participant households in both urban and rural areas of Rizhao city. By applying a quantile regression and counterfactual analysis, this study disentangles the impact of this subsidy program and inherent household attributes on per capita residential electricity consumption. First, contrary to the mean regression, the elasticity of electricity consumption to household's income, age, education and energy-saving awareness, varies markedly across the electricity consumption distribution and shows discrepancy between urban and rural areas. Second, while inherent household attributes are identified as a primary determinant to the changes in residential electricity consumption, the effect induced by the subsidy incentive is more significant at the middle of the electricity consumption distribution than at the tails. Third, there are significant rebound effects that lead to overall increase in household electricity consumption. Our results suggest that the disparity between urban and rural regions and targeted consumer behavior changes should be taken into account to ensure the effectiveness of a future energy-efficient subsidy program.

Area of study: The study was conducted on experimental sites established in two locations within the Turkish red pine natural distribution areas, namely Duaci and Nebiler close to Antalya city. Material and methods: Data were collected from the experimental sites established as a Nelder design (fan-shaped), with 72 rays and 18 arcs (circles), and trees were planted (almost square) at distances ranging from 1.15 to 4.77 m. Soil type of both sites is loamy, with soil clay content varying between 70-87% in Duaci and 51-70% in Nebiler. Soils are deep being more than one m in both sites, but rockier in Nebiler, providing better soil drainage in this site. Main results: The results showed that mean total height was greater at closer spacing than those of wider spacing until age eight. Growth retardation at wider spacing in early years may be related to water loss due to evaporation in hot summer days and weed suppression. Following the age eight, competition among trees appears to be the major factor reducing the growth and carbon fixation. Diameter at breast height and individual tree volume increased, while stand volume, mean annual volume increment and annual carbon storage per hectare considerably decreased for wider spacing. Our results suggest that in order to obtain higher yield and more carbon fixation, short rotation plantations should initially be established in closer spacing, followed by thinning in subsequent years as required by silvicultural concerns. In this context, spacing 3.0 x 1.0 m or 3.0 x 1.5 m (3.0 and 4.5 m(2) growing area per tree, respectively) seems to be more plausible, providing farm machinery for maintenance and harvesting. We also found that mean annual volume increment per unit area can be considerably increased by using improved seed and deep soil cultivation in plantations. Research highlights: Results encourage managers for short rotation management in industrial plantations using closer spacing in terms of carbon sequestration as well as wood production.","Erkan, N, Aydin, AC",0,Antalya,TUR,10.5424/fs/2016252-09290,SRID=4326;POINT (30.69556 36.90812),758188,Effects of spacing on early growth rate and carbon sequestration in Pinus brutia Ten. plantations,2016

However, few studies have investigated the photosynthetic CO2 uptake potential of different urban tree species across seasons. In particular little is known about photosynthetic CO2 uptake in cities with a subtropical, oceanic climate where evergreen species are dominant. We addressed this shortcoming by measuring net photosynthetic rates of ten native and exotic tree species during different seasons and times of the day in Auckland, New Zealand. We also assessed the potential of leaf nitrogen (N) concentration as a proxy for net photosynthetic capacities of urban trees, which is of particular importance to upscale leaf-level photosynthetic CO2 uptake to local and regional scales. In addition, we compared measured net photosynthetic capacities (light-saturated net photosynthetic rates) with carbon (C) sequestration rates estimated using tree growth measurements and allometric equations. Mean net photosynthetic capacities ranged between 2.37 and 10.48 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) across all seasons and were closely related to tree C sequestration rates, suggesting that increased photosynthesis enhances growth rates and therefore tree C sequestration rates. Given that winter net photosynthetic capacities remained high in evergreen species (3.38-13.96 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), with almost 50% higher mean net photosynthetic capacity compared to summer across all species, we suggest that tree planting programmes for CO2 mitigation should favour long living evergreen tree species with high basal area increments (BAI). Leaf N explained 43% and 57% of the variability of photosynthetic capacities across species in summer and winter, respectively. These results indicate that leaf N may be used as a proxy for net photosynthetic capacities of commonly planted urban trees in Auckland.

Early research shows theoretical benefits in terms of exergy efficiency over other technologies. Pilot projects indicate that the concept delivers good performance if heating and cooling demands are diverse. However, the operation of these networks is not yet optimized and there is no quantification of the benefits over other technologies in various scenarios. Moreover, there is a lack of, understanding of how to integrate and control multiple distributed heat and cold sources in such networks. Therefore, this paper develops a control concept based on a temperature set point optimization and agent-based control which allows the modular integration of an arbitrary number of sources and consumers. Afterwards, the concept is applied to two scenarios representing neighborhoods in San Francisco and Cologne with different heating and cooling demands and boundary conditions. The performance of the system is then compared to other state-of-the-art heating and cooling solutions using dynamic simulations with Modelica. The results show that bidirectional low temperature networks without optimization produce 26% less emissions in the San Francisco scenario and 63% in the Cologne scenario in comparison to the other heating and cooling solutions.

492,WOS:000392162700019,"Growing concerns over climate change have led to an increasing interest in the role of the built environment to reduce transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many studies have reported that compact, mixed-use, and well-connected developments reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Others, however, argue that densification and mixture of land uses can slow down vehicle movements, and consequently generate more driving emissions. Methodologically, VMT is only a proxy, not an exact measure of emissions. This study quantifies the net effects of the built environment on household vehicle emissions through a case study of Austin, TX. The study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques and estimated path models to improve understanding of the relationship between the built environment and vehicle emissions. The results show a rather complex picture of the relationship. Densification can reduce regional vehicle emissions despite its secondary effect of reduced vehicle travel speed. A 1% increase in density was found to reduce household vehicle emissions by 0.1%. However, intensification of the design feature of the built environment in developed areas may work in the opposite direction; the modeling results showed a 1% increase in grid-like network being associated with 0.8% increase in household vehicle emissions. Based on the results, the study addressed the potential of and the challenges to reducing vehicle emissions through modifying the built environment in local areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

493,WOS:000294221500008,"Energy consumption is a major cause of air pollution in Beijing, and the adjustment of the energy structure is of strategic importance to the reduction of carbon intensity and the improvement of air quality. In this paper, we explored the future trend of energy structure adjustment in Beijing till 2020, designed five energy scenarios focusing on the fuel substitution in power plants and heating sectors, established emission inventories, and utilized the Mesoscale Modeling System Generation 5 (MM5) and the Models-3/Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) to evaluate the impact of these measures on air quality. By implementing this systematic energy structure adjustment, the emissions of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO (x) , and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) will decrease distinctly by 34.0%, 53.2%, 78.3%, 47.0%, and 30.6% respectively in the most coalintensive scenario of 2020 compared with 2005. Correspondingly, MM5-Models-3/CMAQ simulations indicate significant reduction in the concentrations of major pollutants, implying that energy structure adjustment can play an important role in improving Beijing's air quality. By fuel substitution for power plants and heating boilers, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO (x) , and NMVOCs will be reduced further, but slightly by 1.7%, 4.5%, 11.4%, 13.5%, and 8.8% respectively in the least coal-intensive scenario. The air quality impacts of different scenarios in 2020 resemble each other, indicating that the potential of air quality improvement due to structure adjustment in power plants and heating sectors is limited. However, the CO2 emission is 10.0% lower in the least coal-intensive scenario than in the most coal-intensive one, contributing to Beijing's ambition to build a low carbon city. Except for energy structure adjustment, it is necessary to take further measures to ensure the attainment of air quality standards.","Zhao, B, Xu, JY, Hao, JM",11,Beijing,CHN,10.1007/s11783-011-0357-8,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,"Impact of energy structure adjustment on air quality: a case study in Beijing, China",2011

A multitude of literature mainly focused on single demographic impacts on environmental issues at the national level, and comprehensive studies concerning population-related factors at a city level are rare. This paper employed STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model incorporating PLS (Partial least squares) regression method to examine the influence of population-related factors on carbon emissions in Beijing from 1984 to 2012. Empirically results manifest that urbanization is the paramount driver. Changes in population age structure have significantly positive impacts on carbon emissions, and shrinking young population, continuous expansion of working age population and aging population will keep on increasing environmental pressures. Meanwhile, shrinking household size and expanding floating population boost the discharge of carbon emissions. Besides, per capita consumption is an important contributor of carbon emissions, while industry energy intensity is the main inhibitory factor. Based upon these findings and the specific circumstances of Beijing, policies such as promoting clean and renewable energy, improving population quality and advocating low carbon lifestyles should be enhanced to achieve targeted emissions reductions.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the determinants of urban GHG emissions in order to explain these differences. Design/methodology/approach - Seven global cities - Bangkok, Chicago, London, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan and New York City - have been included in the paper's sample. These cases have been chosen in order to represent a variety of characteristics and contexts of developed and developing countries and according to data availability. A first level of analysis regards local GHG emission inventories, which attribute emissions to activity sectors. Sectorial emissions are then evaluated to quantify the relevance of several determinants: climate conditions, urban form, economic activities in place, state of technology, mobility and housing infrastructures and costs, and income and life style. Findings - Determinants show different weights in influencing behaviours at city level, and ultimately depend on economic, technical, social and cultural factors. Beside a significant role of climate conditions, urban density appears as the main determinant in shaping residential emissions from direct fuel consumption, whereas, for electricity, consumption patterns and technological features of power generation play a major role. For ground transport, urban form affecting mobility patterns and technological features of the vehicle stock stand out as the most significant determinants. Originality/value - The paper provides a deep insight into urban GHG emission values, making use of a comprehensive set of urban data and highlighting several areas which could possibly be targeted in cities' GHG reduction policies. An enhanced and widened set of data could improve the paper's results in a significant way.","Croci, E, Melandri, S, Molteni, T",2,Madrid; London; Bangkok; Mexico City; Chicago; New York City,ESP; GBR; THA; MEX; USA; USA,10.1108/17568691111153429,SRID=4326;POINT (-3.70256 40.4165); SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853); SRID=4326;POINT (100.50144 13.75398); SRID=4326;POINT (-99.12766000000001 19.42847); SRID=4326;POINT (-87.65004999999999 41.85003); SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),3255944; 7556900; 5104476; 12294193; 2720546; 8175133,Determinants of cities' GHG emissions: a comparison of seven global cities,2011

After testing against techno-economic feasibility, compressed natural gas (CNG) technology, four-stroke two-wheelers and battery-operated vehicles (BOV) were selected as candidate options for Mumbai and Delhi. Multiple constrained optimization for finding out the optimal mix of vehicles to meet the travel demand under the business-as-usual scenario for the period of 1998-2020 revealed the dominance of CNG vehicles. CO2 mitigation targets of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% resulted in reduced stock of diesel and petrol vehicles, with the reduction spanning over different points of the above time period. In the case of Mumbai, battery-operated three-wheelers dominated the vehicular mix, with the share of CNG vehicles remaining at a standard level. CO2 reduction targets did not influence the CNG option significantly. CO2 mitigation influenced the dynamics of local pollutants considerably in both Delhi and Mumbai. In Delhi, TSP and SOx reduction levels against the CO2 mitigation target were found to be significant. In Mumbai, the percentage reduction in local pollution (TSP in particular) was higher than the target CO2 reduction. Local pollutants other than TSP and SOx showed an increasing trend against the CO2 mitigation strategies in Delhi.

As the top industrialized and urbanized region in China, Beijing is a good case to show the trends of CO2 emissions in China, and examining how different drivers influence the CO2 emissions direction of Beijing can give valuable insights to other regions on dealing with the emerging climate change issues. To this end, we conducted structural decomposition analysis to quantify the contributions of technological and socio-economic factors to the rapid CO2 emissions growth in Beijing from 1995 to 2007. An increasing final demand level and production structure change led to carbonizing Beijing significantly, while energy intensity improvement was Beijing's sole prominent source on decarbonizing its economic development in 1995-2007. Further, results highlighted the importance of trading and investment in CO2 emissions variations in Beijing. The industrial structure change toward heavy manufacturing and services sectors led to the significant role of these sectors in CO2 emissions growth in Beijing. Beijing's carbonizing process is a reminder to other regions in China to reconsider the direction of their industrial structure change and implement consistent and strict energy-saving policies.

499,WOS:000379417300017,"Cities currently covering only a very small portion ( < aEuro-3aEuro-%) of the world's land surface directly release to the atmosphere about 44aEuro-% of global energy-related CO2, but they are associated with 71-76aEuro-% of CO2 emissions from global final energy use. Although many cities have set voluntary climate plans, their CO2 emissions are not evaluated by the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) procedures that play a key role for market- or policy-based mitigation actions. Here we analyze the potential of a monitoring tool that could support the development of such procedures at the city scale. It is based on an atmospheric inversion method that exploits inventory data and continuous atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements from a network of stations within and around cities to estimate city CO2 emissions. This monitoring tool is configured for the quantification of the total and sectoral CO2 emissions in the Paris metropolitan area (similar to aEuro-12 million inhabitants and 11.4aEuro-TgC emitted in 2010) during the month of January 2011. Its performances are evaluated in terms of uncertainty reduction based on observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). They are analyzed as a function of the number of sampling sites (measuring at 25aEuro-maEuro-a.g.l.) and as a function of the network design. The instruments presently used to measure CO2 concentrations at research stations are expensive (typically similar to aEuro-EURaEuro-50aEuro-k per sensor), which has limited the few current pilot city networks to around 10 sites. Larger theoretical networks are studied here to assess the potential benefit of hypothetical operational lower-cost sensors. The setup of our inversion system is based on a number of diagnostics and assumptions from previous city-scale inversion experiences with real data. We find that, given our assumptions underlying the configuration of the OSSEs, with 10 stations only the uncertainty for the total city CO2 emission during 1 month is significantly reduced by the inversion by similar to aEuro-42aEuro-%. It can be further reduced by extending the network, e.g., from 10 to 70 stations, which is promising for MRV applications in the Paris metropolitan area. With 70 stations, the uncertainties in the inverted emissions are reduced significantly over those obtained using 10 stations: by 32aEuro-% for commercial and residential buildings, by 33aEuro-% for road transport, by 18aEuro-% for the production of energy by power plants, and by 31aEuro-% for total emissions. These results indicate that such a high number of stations would be likely required for the monitoring of sectoral emissions in Paris using this observation-model framework. They demonstrate some high potential that atmospheric inversions can contribute to the monitoring and/or the verification of city CO2 emissions (baseline) and CO2 emission reductions (commitments) and the advantage that could be brought by the current developments of lower-cost medium precision (LCMP) sensors.","Wu, L, Broquet, G, Ciais, P, Bellassen, V, Vogel, F, Chevallier, F, Xueref-Remy, I, Wang, YL",9,Paris,FRA,10.5194/acp-16-7743-2016,SRID=4326;POINT (2.3488 48.85341),2138551,What would dense atmospheric observation networks bring to the quantification of city CO2 emissions?,2016

Methods: Prospective, population-based, 15-month study of police activations of CEDs after their introduction into the police force of a large U.S. city (residential population, 1.25 million). Local policy for use was consistent with the recommendations of International Association of chiefs of Police. Data collected included age, sex, predefined rationale for use, target distance, activation duration, total energy delivered, policy compliance, and medical findings or events within the first 12 hours. Results: Among 426 consecutive CED activations (November 1, 2004 through January 31, 2006), the suspects' mean age (years +/- standard deviation) was 30 +/- 10 (range, 13-72) years and 90.4% were male.

This paper estimates the potential reductions in costs and emissions that could be achieved with tugs or an electric motor embedded in the landing gear to propel aircraft on the ground. The use of tugs would result in the avoidance of $20/ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions if the measure were adopted for all domestic flights. Estimates of average net savings for airlines vary from $100 per flight at John E Kennedy International Airport in New York City to a loss of $160 per flight in Honolulu, Hawaii. Electric taxiing would save between $30 and $240/ton of CO2 emissions avoided. Either approach could reduce CO2 emissions from domestic flights in the United States by about 1.5 million tons each year, or about 1.1% of the total emissions in 2006. If the switch were limited to large narrow-body aircraft on domestic service at the busiest airports in the United States, the total reduction in emissions would be 0.5 million tons of CO2 annually, accompanied by savings of $100/ton.

Verification based on direct observation of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will be necessary to demonstrate that estimated emission reductions have been actualized in the atmosphere. Here we assess the capability of ground-based observations and a high-resolution (1.3 km) mesoscale atmospheric transport model to determine a change in greenhouse gas emissions over time from a metropolitan region. We test the method with observations from a network of CO2 surface monitors in Salt Lake City. Many features of the CO2 data were simulated with excellent fidelity, although data-model mismatches occurred on hourly timescales due to inadequate simulation of shallow circulations and the precise timing of boundary-layer stratification and destratification. Using two optimization procedures, monthly regional fluxes were constrained to sufficient precision to detect an increase or decrease in emissions of approximately 15% at the 95% confidence level. We argue that integrated column measurements of the urban dome of CO2 from the ground and/or space are less sensitive than surface point measurements to the redistribution of emitted CO2 by small-scale processes and thus may allow for more precise trend detection of emissions from urban regions.","McKain, K, Wofsy, SC, Nehrkorn, T, Eluszkiewicz, J, Ehleringer, JR, Stephens, BB",86,Salt Lake City,USA,10.1073/pnas.1116645109,SRID=4326;POINT (-111.89105 40.76078),192672,Assessment of ground-based atmospheric observations for verification of greenhouse gas emissions from an urban region,2012
511,WOS:000295033800004,"La Ceiba, Honduras, a city of about 200,000 people, lies along the Caribbean Sea, nestled against a mountain range and the Rio Cangrejal. The city faces three flooding risks: routine flooding of city streets due to the lack of a stormwater drainage system; occasional major flooding of the Rio Cangrejal, which flows through the city; and flooding from heavy rainfall events and storm surges associated with tropical cyclones. In this study, we applied a method developed for the U.S. Agency for International Development and then worked with stakeholders in La Ceiba to understand climate change risks and evaluate adaptation alternatives. We estimated the impacts of climate change on the current flooding risks and on efforts to mitigate the flooding problems. The climate change scenarios, which addressed sea level rise and flooding, were based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates of sea level rise (Houghton et al. 2001) and published literature linking changes in temperature to more intense precipitation (Trenberth et al., Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 84:1205-1217, 2003) and hurricanes (Knutson and Tuleya, J Clim, 17:3477-3495, 2004). Using information from Trenberth et al., Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 84:1205-1217, (2003) and Knutson and Tuleya, J Clim, 17:3477-3495, 2004, we scaled intense precipitation and hurricane wind speed based on projected temperature increases. We estimated the volume of precipitation in intense events to increase by 2 to 4% in 2025 and by 6 to 14% by 2050. A 13% increase in intense precipitation, the high scenario for 2050, could increase peak 5-year flood flows by about 60%. Building an enhanced urban drainage system that could cope with the estimated increased flooding would cost one-third more than building a system to handle current climate conditions, but would avoid costlier reconstruction in the future. The flow of the Rio Cangrejal would increase by one-third from more intense hurricanes. The costs of raising levees to protect the population from increased risks from climate change would be about $1 million. The coast west of downtown La Ceiba is the most vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surges. It is relatively undeveloped, but is projected to have rapid development. Setbacks on coastal construction in that area may limit risks. The downtown coastline is also at risk and may need to be protected with groins and sand pumping. Stakeholders in La Ceiba concluded that addressing problems of urban drainage should be a top priority. They emphasized improved management of the Rio Cangrejal watershed and improved storm warnings to cope with risks from extreme precipitation and cyclones. Adoption of risk management principles and effective land use management could also help reduce risks from current climate and climate change.","Smith, JB, Strzepek, KM, Cardini, J, Castaneda, M, Holland, J, Quiroz, C, Wigley, TML, Herrero, J, Hearne, P, Furlow, J",2,La Ceiba,HND,10.1007/s10584-011-0161-2,SRID=4326;POINT (-86.78221000000001 15.75971),130218,"Coping with climate variability and climate change in La Ceiba, Honduras",2011

Energy efficiency upgrades can potentially reduce energy expenses and improve thermal comfort, while also addressing problematic issues in the home environment. The present mixed method pilot study explored the impacts of energy efficiency upgrades in 20 households in a low-income community in New York City. Surveys and interviews were administered to the heads of household in a variety of housing types. Interviews were also conducted with landlords of buildings that had recently undergone upgrades. Findings indicate that energy efficiency measures resulted in improved thermal comfort, enhanced health and safety and reduced energy costs. Participants reported largely positive experiences with the upgrades, resulting in direct and indirect benefits. However, results also indicate negative consequences associated with the upgrades and further illustrate that weatherization alone was insufficient to address all of the issues facing low-income households. Moreover, qualitative results revealed differing experiences of low-income renters compared to homeowners. Overall, energy efficiency upgrades are a promising intervention to mitigate the energy and structurally related challenges facing low-income households, but larger scale research is needed to capture the long-term implications of these upgrades.

However, a single large patch is not always sufficient to conserve as many species as possible. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the environment, which is formed by its design and management, plays an important role in species richness. Japanese gardens and the created wildlife habitat park are good solutions for biodiversity. (3) The nature of rivers and wetland systems has been severely degraded in the urbanization process.

However, little is known about the concept's relevance for less competitive cities, especially urban centres facing profound problems associated with economic decline, social deprivation and negative external images or 'structurally disadvantaged cities.' This paper examines how the NEPUD has played out within two structurally disadvantaged maritime port cities in Northern Europe, Hull (UK) and Bremerhaven (Germany). Both cities face serious social and economic challenges associated with long-term industrial decline, such as high unemployment rates, low skill levels, economic peripherality, and poor external images. Nevertheless, new opportunities opened up by climate change and the green economy have prompted political actors in Hull and Bremerhaven to build new alliances between local government, business and civil society and enhance governance capacities on climate change and green urban development. Highlighting similarities and differences between these two places, the paper reveals how climate change regulations provide opportunities for certain structurally disadvantaged cities to attract 'green jobs' and transform their external image.",,0,Hull; Bremerhaven,GBR; DEU,10.12854/erde-148-49,SRID=4326;POINT (-0.33525 53.7446); SRID=4326;POINT (8.57673 53.55021),302296; 117446,"Climate change, the green economy and reimagining the city: the case of structurally disadvantaged European maritime port cities",2017
529,WOS:000306985500007,"Fuel use pattern is crucial to energy saving and pollution reduction, meanwhile, individual fuel choices contribute to the overall pattern of fuel use. By conducting a survey of taxi drivers in Nanjing City in China, this study analyzed the taxis' fuel use pattern in Nanjing and presents empirical evidence on the determinants of taxis' fuel choice. Results show that, the drivers' fuel choices are, to some extent, locked-in by the vehicle models or original fuel types. The inertia of switching from gasoline-powered taxis to natural gas powered ones is associated with personal characteristic factors, such as old age, long experience, and high education, whereas the inclination to fuel switching is usually observed on those who have co-drivers. The high utilization of co-driven taxis makes a better business case on the cost of converting to gas. Vehicle's features, such as validity of vehicle, modification cost during fuel switch, and engine capacity, significantly affect the fuel switch choice of taxi drivers. Seasonal factors also influence the switching choice: more taxis switched to natural gas ones in early summer. Finally, suggestion is given to reduce structural lock-in of fuel choice, cut down the cost of fuel switching, and set extra incentives for such taxi drivers as young and newer during cleaner fuel replacement in China.

OBJECTIVES: It has been an open question whether prenatal exposure to air pollution in general and PAHs in particular significantly increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction, including small size for gestational age (SGA), and preterm delivery. Here, we have examined this hypothesis in a cohort of mothers and newborns in New York City. METHODS: Subjects were young, nonsmoking, healthy African-American (n = 224) and Dominican (n = 392) mother-newborn pairs residing in New York City whose prenatal PAH exposures were estimated by personal air monitoring. Questionnaire and medical record data were obtained. RESULTS: A 1 natural-log (ln)-unit increase in prenatal PAH exposure was associated with a 2-fold increase in risk of symmetric intrauterine growth restriction (i.e., SGA and fetal growth ratio < 85%) among full-terin African Americans (P < 0.05). Preterm. delivery risk was 5-fold greater among African Americans per In-unit increase in prenatal PAH exposure. The same unit increase in exposure significantly increased the ratio of head circumference to birth weight by 0.04% in Americans. These effects were not observed in Dominicans. CONCLUSION: Prenatal PAH exposure is likely to contribute to the occurrence of SGA as well as preterm births among African Americans. The lack of an association in Dominicans might reflect modification of the risk by healthful cultural practices among recent Dominican immigrants. Given that PAHs are globally generated and distributed pollutants, our observations have potential implications for environmental health and energy policies.",,112,New York City,USA,10.1289/ehp.10958,SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),8175133,Prenatal exposure to airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and risk of intrauterine growth restriction,2008
532,WOS:000367639600036,"Both the public and policy-makers are concerned about the observed impacts and anticipated future consequences of climate change. Attention to adaptation focuses on reduction of climate change vulnerability and increase of adaptive capacity. In order to better understand the role of decision-making in urban forestry, this paper assesses the perceptions of urban forestry stakeholders towards climate change adaptation, in the city of Belgrade (Serbia), based on Q-method interviews. The views of respondents were clustered into three distinct perspectives: (a) 'Management-oriented perspective', (b) 'Sceptics', (c) 'General-awareness perspective'. Overall, a majority of interviewees (50%) are allocated to group (a), about a third to group (c), and only a minority (15%) to group (b). The sceptics' perspective holds the opinion that climate variations are normal and there is insufficient evidence to prove the existence of climate change. Representatives of the two other perspectives recognize climate change as a challenge, but adopt different opinions to communication and coordination of the adaptation process. While the 'Management-oriented perspective' is advocating for more bottom-up initiatives and improvement of dialogue between stakeholders, the 'General-awareness perspective' opine that climate change is an issue to be governed by the national level organizations. Through these three varied perspectives, the main factors for the current lack of responses to climate change adaptation and related needs in urban forestry are identified: lack of coordination and communication between stakeholders, lack of scale-relevant technical and scientific data, lack of specific regulations and financial means. To move forward, we recommend empowering various stakeholders, improving organizational relations and introducing various means of education and information-sharing mechanisms.

The study assesses potential responses of urban water suppliers to reduced water availability by examining an analogous case of reduced supply in the Denver metropolitan region. In this case the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's veto of a large surface storage project (the Two Forks dam) prompted water providers in metropolitan Denver to take other actions to ensure adequate future water supply. In some cases, actions taken since the veto process began represent a departure from previous water provider policies. It is argued that similar institutional adjustments may occur due to climate change-induced reductions in regional water supplies and that useful lessons may be drawn from an analysis of institutional responses to the Two Forks veto. This paper introduces what is envisioned as a long-term assessment of regional adjustments to reduced future water supplies.","RHODES, SL, MILLER, KA, MACDONNELL, LJ",2,Denver,USA,10.1029/91WR02382,SRID=4326;POINT (-104.9847 39.73915),682545,INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE - WATER PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS IN THE DENVER METROPOLITAN REGION,1992
535,WOS:000371937100012,"Vehicle electrification is a promising approach towards attaining green transportation. However, the absence of charging stations limits the penetration of electric vehicles. Current approaches for optimizing the locations of charging stations suffer from challenges associated with spatial-temporal dynamic travel demands and the lengthy period required for the charging process. The present article uses the electric taxi (ET) as an example to develop a spatial-temporal demand coverage approach for optimizing the placement of ET charging stations in the space-time context. To this end, public taxi demands with spatial and temporal attributes are extracted from massive taxi GPS data. The cyclical interactions between taxi demands, ETs, and charging stations are modeled with a spatial temporal path tool. A location model is developed to maximize the level of ET service on the road network and the level of charging service at the stations under spatial and temporal constraints such as the ET range, the charging time, and the capacity of charging stations. The reduced carbon emission generated by used ETs with located charging stations is also evaluated. An experiment conducted in Shenzhen, China demonstrates that the proposed approach not only exhibits good performance in determining ET charging station locations by considering temporal attributes, but also achieves a high quality trade-off between the levels of ET service and charging service. The proposed approach and obtained results help the decision-making of urban ET charging station siting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

536,WOS:000386991600043,"Coupling with rapid economic development and continual urban expansion, CO2 as the dominant contributor to the greenhouse has aggravated the global climate change, such that achieving the joint goal of increasing electricity demand and mitigating CO2 emission become crucial to plan electric power systems (EPS). Various complexities and uncertainties exist in the real-world EPS problems, which can affect the optimization processes as well as the generated decision schemes. In this study, a two-stage interval-possibilistic programming (TIPP) method is developed for planning carbon emission trading (CET) in the EPS of Qingdao (China), where dual uncertainties expressed as interval-random variables and interval-possibilistic parameters can be handled. Techniques of support vector regression (SVR) and Monte Carlo simulation are used for predicting electricity demand and CO2 emission. Four scenarios corresponding to different CO2-emission permits and CO2-mitigation levels have been analyzed. Results reveal that coal-fired power is the primary CO2-emission emitter, and it tends to the transition to renewable energy-dominated power with the CO2-mitigation levels from 5% to 30% (e.g., contributing to 0.6% increment of renewable energies and [30.8, 33.1] % reduction of treated CO2 emissions). Compared to without CET scheme, CO2 emissions can be reduced about 5% under the CET, demonstrating that CET can help to promote the cleaner production of the local electricity. The findings can help decision makers reallocate carbon permits among different emitters effectively, provide appropriate mitigation plan for CO2-emission, as well as to improve environmental and sustainable EPS planning.

537,WOS:000410896900001,"China and India together have more than one third of the world population and are two emerging economic giants of the developing world now experiencing rapid economic growth, urbanization, and motorization. The urban transportation sector is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in China and India. The goal of this study is to analyze the characteristics and factors of CO2 emissions produced by commuters in Chinese and Indian cities and thus to identify strategies for reducing transportation CO2 emissions and mitigating global climate change. Xi'an in China and Bangalore in India were chosen as two case study cities for their representativeness of major cities in China and India. The trends of CO2 emissions produced by major traffic modes (electric motors, buses, and cars) in major cities of China and India were predicted and analyzed. The spatial distributions of CO2 emissions produced by commuters in both cities were assessed using spatial analysis module in ArcGIS (Geographic Information System) software. Tobit models were then developed to investigate the impact factors of the emissions. The study has several findings. Firstly, in both cities, the increase of vehicle occupancy could reduce commuting CO2 emissions by 20 to 50 % or conversely, if vehicle occupancy reduces, an increase by 33.33 to 66.67 %. It is estimated that, with the current increasing speed of CO2 emissions in Xi'an, the total CO2 emissions from electric motors, buses, and cars in major cities of China and India will be increased from 135 x 10(6) t in 2012 to 961x 10(6) t in 2030, accounting for 0.37 to 2.67 % of the total global CO2 emissions of 2013, which is significant for global climate change. Secondly, households and individuals in the outer areas of both cities produce higher emissions than those in the inner areas. Thirdly, the lower emissions in Xi'an are due to the higher density and more compact urban pattern, shorter commuting distances, higher transit shares, and more clean energy vehicles. The more dispersed and extensive urban sprawl and the prevalence of twowheeler motorbikes (two-wheeler motorbike is abbreviated as Btwo-wheeler<^> in the following sections) fueled by gasoline cause higher emissions in Bangalore. Fourthly, car availability, higher household income, living outside the 2nd or Outer Ring Road, distance from the bus stop, and working in the foreign companies in Bangalore are significant and positive factors of commuting CO2 emissions. Fifthly, ""70-20"" and ""50-20"" (this means that generally, 20 % of commuters and households produce 70 % of total emissions in Xi'an and 20 % of commuters and households produce 50 % of total emissions in Bangalore) emission patterns exist in Xi'an and Bangalore, respectively. Several strategies have been proposed to reduce urban CO2 emissions produced by commuters and further to mitigate global climate change. Firstly, in the early stage of fast urbanization, enough monetary and land investment should be ensured to develop rail transit or rapid bus routes from outer areas to inner areas in the cities to avoid high dependency on cars, thus to implement the transit-oriented development (TOD), which is the key for Chinese and Indian cities to mitigate the impact on global climate change caused by CO2 emissions. Secondly, in Bangalore, it is necessary to improve public transit service and increase the bus stop coverage combined with car demand controls along the ring roads, in the outer areas, and in the industry areas where Indian foreign companies and the governments are located. Thirdly, Indian should put more efforts to provide alternative cleaner transport modes while China should put more efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from high emitters.",,2,Bengaluru,IND,10.1007/s11027-016-9704-1,SRID=4326;POINT (77.59369 12.97194),5104047,Urban CO2 emissions in Xi'an and Bangalore by commuters: implications for controlling urban transportation carbon dioxide emissions in developing countries,2017

However, it is an under researched area, even though in major cities, where transport networks are most congested, it forms a higher proportion of trips. The paper presents the findings of a study of changing business travel practices and policies affecting the briefcase traveller. The findings are drawn from semi-structured interviews with key actors in stakeholder and private sector organisations based predominately in London and a survey of 150 business travellers. The study was designed to understand the motivations and attitudes towards reducing business travel and the compromises that needed to be made to balance reducing carbon emissions and cost, whilst maintaining or improving productivity and meeting the requirements of the business. The main findings show the approaches and implications of these approaches to reduce carbon emissions and costs, improve productivity and the impact of ICT. The findings show the importance of external reporting through the Carbon Reduction Commitment, the Carbon Disclosure Project and corporate responsibility reports as a motivator to develop new policies. The paper goes on to outline how some factors can be both barriers and motivations for change, such as customers insisting on meeting their suppliers face-to-face, but also requiring information on carbon emissions as part of the Carbon Disclosure Project. Individuals can also be both a barrier and a motivator to change. The role of existing travel and meeting habits and the view of some that travelling is a perk linked to status symbols have proved to be a hard barriers to overcome.

Operable windows are almost a given for housing and the UK climate is rarely extreme enough to restrict people's use of those windows for natural ventilation. This is a potential problem for the use of heat-recovery systems and could greatly reduce their energy efficiency.

First. the optimum balance of mechanical and natural ventilation is estimated and used to determine the maximum potential saving it could give when compared with natural ventilation alone. Short-term monitoring of the building in question together with the results of questionnaires showed why this theoretical balance is not achieved and that the energy consumption is likely to be worse than for natural ventilation alone. Noise, perceived control, perceived freshness and misunderstanding are all discussed as possible causes for the apparent disjunction.

542,WOS:000334069100015,"BACKGROUND: Shifting to active modes of transport in the trip to work can achieve substantial co-benefits for health, social equity, and climate change mitigation. Previous integrated modeling of transport scenarios has assumed active transport mode share and has been unable to incorporate acknowledged system feedbacks. OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of policies to increase bicycle commuting in a car-dominated city and explored the role of participatory modeling to support transport planning in the face of complexity. METHODS: We used system dynamics modeling (SDM) to compare realistic policies, incorporating feedback effects, nonlinear relationships, and time delays between variables. We developed a system dynamics model of commuter bicycling through interviews and workshops with policy, community, and academic stakeholders. We incorporated best available evidence to simulate five policy scenarios over the next 40 years in Auckland, New Zealand. Injury, physical activity, fuel costs, air pollution, and carbon emissions outcomes were simulated. RESULTS: Using the simulation model, we demonstrated the kinds of policies that would likely be needed to change a historical pattern of decline in cycling into a pattern of growth that would meet policy goals. Our model projections suggest that transforming urban roads over the next 40 years, using best practice physical separation on main roads and bicycle-friendly speed reduction on local streets, would yield benefits 10-25 times greater than costs. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first integrated simulation model of future specific bicycling policies. Our projections provide practical evidence that may be used by health and transport policy makers to optimize the benefits of transport bicycling while minimizing negative consequences in a cost-effective manner. The modeling process enhanced understanding by a range of stakeholders of cycling as a complex system. Participatory SDM can be a helpful method for integrating health and environmental outcomes in transport and urban planning.","Macmillan, A, Connor, J, Witten, K, Kearns, R, Rees, D, Woodward, A",47,Auckland,NZL,10.1289/ehp.1307250,SRID=4326;POINT (174.76349 -36.84853),417910,The Societal Costs and Benefits of Commuter Bicycling: Simulating the Effects of Specific Policies Using System Dynamics Modeling,2014

Currently, the fleet of EVs in Norway is the largest per capita in the world. From a transportation research perspective, the questions immediately asked are (i) what economic incentives make the purchase and use of EVs in Norway so attractive to road users; (ii) do these incentives have any adverse effects and, if so, how large are they; and (iii) how does the marginal external cost of EVs compare to that of conventional vehicles. Method We explore the above questions using available data, the literature and personal observations while relating to the city of Oslo as a case study. Results We find that the tremendous increase in the use of EVs is the result of multiple economic incentives, such as exemption from toll charges, exemption from purchase duties and permission to use transit lanes that induce road users to purchase and use EVs. The increase in EVs has led to a reduction in CO2 emissions. However, some of the EV incentives have adverse effects, the most serious of which is the exemption from toll charges, which has led to a sizable loss of toll revenue. We find that the marginal external cost of EVs' road use is approximately the same as that for a conventional vehicle. Conclusions The incentives for EVs should consider the adverse effects and how electricity is produced; the Norwegian approach should not be followed by other countries without due consideration of these factors.","Aasness, MA, Odeck, J",11,Oslo,NOR,10.1007/s12544-015-0182-4,SRID=4326;POINT (10.74609 59.91273),580000,The increase of electric vehicle usage in Norway-incentives and adverse effects,2015

This paper has as objectives the primary energy analysis and economic evaluation of solar thermal and photovoltaic cooling systems used for the air conditioning in office buildings applying simulation systems. Due to the climatic conditions influence on the performance of these two systems, the comparison is made for three different climates corresponding to Palermo, Madrid and Stuttgart. For each climate the same geometry and dimensions of a building are considered but with different user profiles and construction, consequently different heating and cooling loads, in total 12 cases are taken into consideration. The consumption of electricity is favored with the electricity produced by the photovoltaic modules, which covers in some of the studied cases almost the half of the total energy demand, therefore the relative primary energy savings reaches 50%, while in the case of the solar thermal system, the relative primary energy savings reaches 37% in Palermo, 36% in Madrid, and 29% in Stuttgart. Hence, simulations to determine the best work parameters in each place are suggested for the reduction of energy demands and a sensitivity analysis is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Land cover is calculated form time-series aerial photographs in terms of ""hard"" cover (buildings, paved areas and roads) and ""soft"" cover (trees, green areas and waterbodies). The period selected for analysis includes pre-rapid (up to 1977) and rapid urban phases (1978 onwards) in the city. Contemporary Sri Lanka's urbanization is peculiar in that mid to late 20th century urban rates (approx. 22% of the population) had remained virtually unchanged till the economy was liberalized in 1977, but have recently intensified (currently at about 35%). This offers a unique window of opportunity to look at the thermal comfort transition consequent to urbanization. Since many tropical cities are at a similar stage of demographic transition, lessons from Colombo may generally be applicable to other tropical developing cities as well. An increasing trend in thermal discomfort-particularly at night-is seen especially at the suburban station and it correlates well with hard land cover changes. The study also brings out the relative importance of land cover in city center vs. rural areas (e.g. hard cover has more effect on thermal discomfort in city center than in rural areas). Based on these findings, we postulate an outline for a climate-sensitive urban design policy for tropical cities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

547,WOS:000239935100001,"Urban sustainable development (SD) is a key concern of policy and decision-makers. As a result, numerous sustainability studies have been commissioned by government agencies that have led to the recommendation of suites of indicators to assess a host of related socio-economic and environmental issues. Many of these indicators have been described in concept only and a major challenge for science remains in translating verbal indicator descriptions into quantifiable measures. A Landsat-based Canadian national urban land database is being generated at the Canada Centre of Remote Sensing along with a set of urban sustainability indicators as value-added information to support informed transportation energy policy decision-making. This paper addresses indicator quantification, using the remote-sensing derived urban land use data, in the context of urban transportation-related energy consumption resulting from urban sprawl. Our work on quantification of sustainability indicators involves extraction of information about the characteristics of urban form (density, compactness and land use mix) and analysis of its impacts on land use efficiency, transportation and the environment. A generalized methodology for the categorization of indicators is presented based the level of information input and sophistication Of Computation needed for their quantification. Four indicators are discussed (population density, compactness, travel mode index and probability of travel distance) that span the category spectrum. Each indicator presents unique challenges in achieving its quantification in the form of information integration, analytic formulation or modeling. Example results for the cities of Ottawa-Gatineau and Calgary provide a preliminary insight into the difficulties in utilizing indicators for inter-city sustainability comparisons.

548,WOS:000419167100008,"Several scientific papers and technical reports have discussed the role of green public procurement in the food sector. Different strategies for the restoration sector have been identified. However, there is not yet a common understanding of which policies could be the most efficient in reducing the global warming potential of the public restoration service. This paper assesses a set of procurement policies, ranking them according to their potential to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of public catering. Eleven relevant green public procurement policies were identified from the literature. These are discussed in the context of a case study of the school catering service in the city of Turin (Italy). Initially, a life cycle approach is applied to a baseline scenario of the collective restoration system of the city, to quantify the quantity of greenhouse gases produced by the entire catering service (including all stages from the production of food to the management of waste from kitchens and canteens). Afterwards, the 11 policies were applied to the baseline scenario so that the potential improvement achieved by each policy could be quantified. The baseline scenario resulted in 1.67 kgCO(2)eq per average meal. The production of food dominates the global warming potential of the full service, being responsible for about 78% of the greenhouse gas emissions. Among the selected policies, a change in diet was the most effective (leading to a 32% reduction of the CO(2)eq emissions), followed by the adoption of improved food production practices (11% reduction) and the purchasing of certified green electricity (6% reduction). The proposed method allows the assessment of procurement policies in the catering service by applying a simplified life cycle approach that considers all the stages of the process. Public authorities and other stakeholders could benefit from basing their decisions upon scientific evidence and avoiding the prioritisation of policies based on personal opinions or weak evidence.

549,WOS:000355585500002,"The control of the aeration time and the dissolved oxygen in a reactor plays an important role in the management of the plant and the reduction of energy consumption. For this, two full-scale municipal waste-water treatment plants were chosen. The first plant (Choutrana II) designed for 600,000 population-equivalents (p.e), consists of a primary treatment step (screening, grit and grease removal), followed by four parallel oxidation ditches with a total volume of 60,000 m(3). Aeration is ensured by air diffuser. The second plant (Menzel Bourguiba) designed for 140,000 p.e consists of a primary treatment stage (screening, grit and grease removal), followed by anoxic tanks and two aerobic reactors with a total volume of 14,000 m(3). Aeration is ensured by six surface aerators which are operated episodically to create aerobic and anoxic conditions. Currently, the aeration management is controlled by a timer with a maintained oxygen concentration at a given level in the aerobic reactor. The nitrogen removal is done during air-on and air-off periods. The process can be seen as a succession of aeration periods followed by an anoxic period. This category of plant operation is far from the optimal and raises energy consumption and operative costs. The purpose of this study is to implement a new strategy to control aeration taking into account the variation of the daily organic load received by plants (feedforward control) and to create favorable conditions for nitrification and denitrification steps (feedback control). The Activated Sludge Model 1, which is calibrated and validated by respirometry tests, is used. Simulation results show the potentialities of the chosen strategy, which could save 28% of aeration energy and could adjust the aerobic and anoxic times. As first results, daily aeration time could be considered enough to produce treated water conform to standard terms. For Choutrana II plant, the results obtained have allowed to achieve a nitrogen removal rate of 85% and an output concentration between 6 and 12 mg/L. Rates of nitrification and denitrification were estimated at 4 mg NO3-N/L/h and 6 mg NH4-N/L/h, respectively. At the same time, aeration periods (on/off) are connected with daily organic load received by the plant and created favorable conditions for nitrification-denitrification.

This paper introduces an urban model that can be used to evaluate city resilience outcomes under different policy scenarios. The model is the Wellington Integrated Land Use-Transport-Environment Model (WILUTE). It considers the city (i.e., Wellington) as a complex system characterized by interactions between a variety of internal urban processes (social, economic and physical) and the natural environment. It is focused on exploring the dynamic relations between human activities (the geographic distribution of housing and employment, infrastructure layout, traffic flows and energy consumption), environmental effects (carbon emissions, influences on local natural and ecological systems) and potential natural disasters (e.g., inundation due to sea level rise and storm events) faced under different policy scenarios. The model gives insights that are potentially useful for policy to enhance the city's resilience, by modelling outcomes, such as the potential for reduction in transportation energy use, and changes in the vulnerability of the city's housing stock and transport system to sea level rise.","Zhao, PJ, Chapman, R, Randal, E, Howden-Chapman, P",6,Wellington,NZL,10.3390/su5073202,SRID=4326;POINT (174.77557 -41.28664),381900,Understanding Resilient Urban Futures: A Systemic Modelling Approach,2013

The study estimate the amount of emissions saved if the electrical energy needed for the vehicles is generated with nuclear power plants. The use of zero-emission vehicles could play an important role in reducing our dependence on oil and, therefore, changing the economy structure of the country. Therefore, as a representing city, Madrid's nowadays situation is studied. The city's vehicle fleet is first considered and classified. An average both daily and annually fuel consumption is made, in order to know the city's gasoline investment Moreover, the health effects of air pollution, which is largely due to the city's vehicles, are statistically considered in order to analyze the economic impact of treating these effects. Furthermore, noise pollution and it's both direct and indirect consequences are studied. After having analyzed Madrid's situation, a comparison between some international cities and the Spanish capital is made, regarding their vehicle fleet and their environmental and economical consequences. European environmental policy and future criteria are exposed. Regarding the technical feasibility, two types of zero-emission technologies are considered, the battery-electric car and de hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV). After having described the benefits and disadvantages of the use of zero-emission vehicles, a macroeconomic analysis is done in order to study the economic feasibility of the project. To do this, not only several economic variables, such as gross domestic product in the area, but also survey data, such as the average daily driving time are considered. Finally, a strategic plan for a gradual implementation of zero-emission vehicles in the city of Madrid is proposed, taking into account the quantity of emissions saved if the electrical energy needed is generated with nuclear power plants. In this plan, some policy actions are proposed for a gradual implementation.

Currently, the vast majority of the heat used in these applications is obtained by burning natural gas. Geothermal energy production from deep aquifer systems in the sedimentary basin could provide an alternative sustainable source of heat that would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To date there has been no geothermal field development in Alberta because the average geothermal gradient was considered to be too low for economic geothermal energy generation. However, with new technologies for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), it may be possible to develop geothermal resources from the sedimentary rocks in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). A numerical feasibility study based on a regional geological model and existing and newly gained data was conducted to identify scenarios for geothermal energy production in the region. In central Alberta, three Devonian carbonate formations (Cooking Lake, Nisku, Wabamun) and the Cambrian Basal Sandstone Unit were identified as the highest geothermal potential zones. Thermal-hydraulic reservoir simulations for a 5 km x 5 km site in the city of Edmonton were performed to evaluate reservoir development concepts for these four potential target formations: therefore, hydraulic fracturing treatments were also simulated. Different utilization concepts are presented for possible applications of geothermal energy generation in residential, industrial and agricultural areas. The Cooking Lake formation and the Basal Sandstone Unit are potentially the most promising reservoirs because the most heat can be extracted and the applications for the heat are widespread although the costs are higher than utilizing the shallower formations.

556,WOS:000373920100018,"In contrast to recent advances in projecting sea levels, estimations about the economic impact of sea level rise are vague. Nonetheless, they are of great importance for policy making with regard to adaptation and greenhouse-gas mitigation. Since the damage is mainly caused by extreme events, we propose a stochastic framework to estimate the monetary losses from coastal floods in a confined region. For this purpose, we follow a Peak-over-Threshold approach employing a Poisson point process and the Generalised Pareto Distribution. By considering the effect of sea level rise as well as potential adaptation scenarios on the involved parameters, we are able to study the development of the annual damage. An application to the city of Copenhagen shows that a doubling of losses can be expected from a mean sea level increase of only 11 cm. In general, we find that for varying parameters the expected losses can be well approximated by one of three analytical expressions depending on the extreme value parameters. These findings reveal the complex interplay of the involved parameters and allow conclusions of fundamental relevance. For instance, we show that the damage typically increases faster than the sea level rise itself. This in turn can be of great importance for the assessment of sea level rise impacts on the global scale. Our results are accompanied by an assessment of uncertainty, which reflects the stochastic nature of extreme events. While the absolute value of uncertainty about the flood damage increases with rising mean sea levels, we find that it decreases in relation to the expected damage.","Boettle, M, Rybski, D, Kropp, JP",8,Copenhagen,DNK,10.5194/nhess-16-559-2016,SRID=4326;POINT (12.56553 55.67594),1153615,Quantifying the effect of sea level rise and flood defence-a point process perspective on coastal flood damage,2016

While fuel switching and heat pumps have been proposed as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy reduction strategies at the building scale, this paper shows that heat pump adoption could have additional system-wide benefits by increasing the utilization of wind-generated electricity. A model was developed to evaluate the effects of coupling large-scale wind power installations in New York State with increased use of electric heat pumps to meet a portion of space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) demands in New York City. The analysis showed significant increases in wind-generated electricity utilization with increased use of heat pumps, allowing for higher installed capacity of wind power. One scenario indicates that 78.5% annual wind-generated electricity utilization can be achieved with 3 GW of installed wind power capacity generated electricity equal to 20% of existing NYC annual electricity demand; if 20% of space heating and DHW demands are provided by heat pumps, the 78.5% utilization rate can be achieved with an increase of total wind power capacity to 5 GW.

559,WOS:000299404200012,"Amongst the existing forest types in Europe, the specific biological function of water is nowhere more distinctive than in the lowland forest ecosystems. Consequently no existing forest types are more shaped by historic hydrologic conditions, altered by manmade deviations from the natural water regime and vulnerable to consequences of global warming. The lowermost parts of the lowland forests, the wetlands, present the transitional zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems i.e. ponds, lakes, streams and rivers. Nowadays, due to excessive urbanization and the spread of agriculture, the total area of lowland forests and wetlands has been significantly reduced. One of the largest complexes of alluvial floodplain wetlands and lowland forests in Europe are situated in the South-East Europe, in the Sava and Drava River basins, tributaries to the Danube River The Sava River is a unique example of a river where the floodplains are still intact, supporting both flood alleviation and biodiversity. Continental lowland forests in Croatia cover an area of more than 200.000 ha with a significant role in forestry production, flood reduction, recharging groundwater reserves, as well as filtering pollutants. The natural forest vegetation consists of mainly hardwood tree species such as the common oak (Quercus robur L.), field ash (Fraxinus excelsior Vahl.), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) and softwood species such as black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Geartn.), poplars (Populus sp.) and willows (Salix sp.). For the biological diversity of lowland forests and attached wetlands is strongly important specific combination of hydrology and soils. The development of these forests in history was determined by regular seasonal alternations of groundwater tables (hydro period) and periodic flooding. This paper presents the possibilities for the re-establishment of the water regime of lowland forests as one option to reduce the impact of climate change in the future. To reduce negative impacts of anthropogenic alternations in the groundwater regime from the past and to attenuate slow down future very possible prolongation of droughts and water scarcity in the lowlands, various forest managerial and engineering practices could be considered. Basically, there are potentially two main contrasted measures of soil water balance manipulation: drainage of soils (through drainage ditches and channels) which contribute to decreasing the groundwater tables and forest management i.e. (tendering and thinning) which contribute to increased soil water content and increase in the groundwater level. Through these water table management practices, the amount of soil water required for the survival of lowland forests could be maintained to some degree to attenuate the negative hydrologic trends and natural hazards such as droughts. The comprehensive methodological review of activities that must precede such reconstruction activities are presented. As the initial segment all the major components of floodplain ecosystems - the morphology of the terrain, hydrography, soils stratigraphy, vegetation and anthropogenic influences - should be assessed. As a next step methodological options towards how to obtain the knowledge of the natural water regime prior anthropogenic hydrotechnical activities which caused the creation of the ecosystem in its current form are presented. For this purpose the morphology of hydromorphic soils i.e. relict indicators of natural water regime in lowland habitats are assessed. The next step includes the spatial determination of critical areas orhot spots, threatened by excessive falls in the groundwater level on which specific measures can be applied to return to natural water regime conditions (i.e. water retention in dry riverbeds).","Pilas, I, Planinsek, S",1,Sava,ITA,,SRID=4326;POINT (17.55267 40.40203),15898,THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WATER REGIME IN LOWLAND FORESTS IN SUPPORT OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT,2011

In this study, associations were assessed by means of time-series analyses over the period 1995-1999 for Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest industrial city, which has a subtropical climate. Ambient exposures to various air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and particulate matter (PM(10)), were estimated from the arithmetic means of all daily measurements taken by an air quality monitoring station nearest to the residential district. Generalized additive models with non-parametric spline were used to identify associations between daily mortality and air pollutants as well as the air pollutant-temperature interaction correlation. Our findings indicate that CO is associated with increased risks of non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality. For a 0.2 ppm increase in CO, the increased relative daily risk of non-accidental death is at least 4% on the same day, when the mean temperature is above 24.8 degrees C, while the increased relative risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases is 7% two days later at 19.7 degrees C. The study also suggests a statistically significant interaction between CO concentration and daily mean temperature, with non-accidental mortality increasing with a warm outdoor temperature and the effect of CO on cardiovascular mortality being modified by a cold climate.

563,WOS:000310864700003,"Building sustainability assessments are driving greater market demand for sustainable buildings in the developed world. However, do such assessments actually demonstrate building sustainability? Some critics of building sustainability assessment argue that the methods should evolve toward an ""absolute"" assessment of building sustainability. That is, rather than assessing a building relative to a average like-type building as is typically done, the assessment should be made to whatever is deemed sustainable using a credible science. One possible form of absolute assessment is using the indicator of sustainability known as carrying capacity. After discussing the opportunities with a carrying-capacity-based assessment of buildings, this paper proposes a computational model that provides such an assessment. There are four main components to the presented computational model. The first is the amount of carbon (C) stored on the building site in its native state. This native-site carbon storage is defined as the baseline carbon storage and represents the carrying capacity of the building project. The second is land use change, which accounts for the removal or addition of vegetation and other carbon storing elements to the project site. The third and fourth carbon emissions sources in the model are building construction and operation. A building is considered sustainable in the model if by the end of its expected lifetime the total amount of carbon emissions are completely offset. Building designers and their clients can use this model to more comprehensively account for carbon emissions and identify options for reducing and offsetting them. To drive greater adoption, the model has been developed into an online resource, Green Footstep (www. greenfootstep.org). To demonstrate the usefulness of the model, this paper presents a case study of an institutional building in Lake Placid, Florida, USA. The case study shows that the design team used the model to better understand what it means to have a ""low-carbon"" goal. The model showed them that over one hundred years, the building project must reduce and offset carbon emissions at a rate of 16 tonnes C per year. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

564,WOS:000391079300041,"Tailpipe emissions of gasoline vehicles are one of a main cause of atmospheric environmental problems such as global warming and haze. The substitution of electric vehicles for conventional gasoline vehicles is a promising new way to reduce urban air pollution in many countries such as America, Japan, the EU countries and China. In 2011, Beijing launched a plan that was the substitution of electric vehicles (such as Midi taxis) for gasoline vehicles (such as Hyundai taxis) to low carbon transformations. Our study used local data and LCA based analysis to compare environmental impacts of the transition from Hyundai gasoline vehicles to Midi electric vehicles. We established a life.cycle analysis (LCA) model with GaBi6 software and a life cycle assessment integrated model by CML2001 (Problem oriented) and EI99 (Damage oriented) models, which evaluated the comparative environmental impacts of the full life cycle, production stage, use stage and end of life. Finally, we analyzed the key haze-induced factors, key life cycle processes and the sensitivities of lifetime and electric power mbc. Our results indicated that in light of the full life cycle assessment, electric vehicles could play significant role in decreasing the potential of Global Warming, Abiotic Depletion and Ozone Layer Depletion; whereas, electric vehicles also exhibited the impacts for increases in the potential of Acidification, Eutrophication, Human Toxicity and Eco-toxicity (marine aquatic and terrestrial). On the basis of inventory data analysis and 2010 Beijing electricity mix, the comparative results of haze-induced pollutants emissions showed that the full life cycle emission of VOCs from a Midi electric vehicle was lower than a Hyundai gasoline vehicle, but the emissions of PM2.5, NOx, SOX of a Midi electric vehicle were higher than a Hyundai gasoline vehicle. These differences are mainly the result of different emissions during the use stages. In addition, the results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the decreased rate of Green House Gas per kilometer (Midi relative to Hyundai) gradually improved with the increase of lifetime and use of cleaner energy; haze-induced pollutants and carbon emissions from EVs could be reduced significantly with the increased use of cleaner energy.

This clean technology has potential to contribute a lot to water security, sustainable development, and world stability. In this article, results of the energy as well as exergy analysis performed on this novel system integrated with solar pond are presented. This theoretical analysis is carried out in the climatic conditions of New Delhi (India) during a typical summer day. The model and procedures can be helpful in the design, and performance investigation of the actual system anywhere in the world. The daily productivity, energy, and exergy efficiency of the passive solar still are found to be 5 L/m(2), 38.63 %, and 2.71 %, respectively, corresponding to a sum total of 24.436 MJ/m(2) day solar energy input in passive mode. With the integration of solar pond in the active solar still, the daily productivity, energy, and exergy efficiency rises to about 9.5 L/m(2), 46 %, and 14.81 % respectively, for thermal energy input from 100 to 500 W/m(2) during off-sunshine hours. The further improvement in the performance of the same system is observed if the thermal energy is supplied continuously (24 h) to the solar still in addition to incident solar radiation.

This paper develops a framework to understand the political-economic determinants of institutional response capacity through an examination of climate change governance in Mexico City and Santiago, Chile. We ask whether being a frontrunner (Mexico City) is an indicator of greater institutional response capacity. Although Mexico City has slightly higher levels of institutional capacity than Santiago, both are faced with similar challenges, such as fragmented governance arrangements, asymmetries in access to information, and top-down decision making. However, both also have similar opportunities, such as leadership, participation in transnational networks, and potential to integrate climate change goals into existing policy agendas. Examining urban climate change planning in isolation from other institutions is therefore likely to provide a false sense of a city's response capacity.","Romero-Lankao, P, Hughes, S, Rosas-Huerta, A, Borquez, R, Gnatz, DM",15,Mexico City; Santiago,MEX; CHL,10.1068/c12173,SRID=4326;POINT (-99.12766000000001 19.42847); SRID=4326;POINT (-70.64827 -33.45694),12294193; 4837295,Institutional capacity for climate change responses: an examination of construction and pathways in Mexico City and Santiago,2013
567,WOS:000343336700026,"Cities are the main contributors to the CO2 rise in the atmosphere. The CO2 released from the various emission sources is typically quantified by a bottom-up aggregation process that accounts for emission factors and fossil fuel consumption data. This approach does not consider the heterogeneity and variability of the urban emission sources, and error propagation can result in large uncertainties. These uncertainties might lead to unsound mitigation policies. Monitoring systems of greenhouse gases (GHG) based on independent methods are needed to validate the accuracy of the estimated emissions. In this context, direct measurements of CO2 fluxes that include all major and minor anthropogenic and natural sources and sinks from a specific district can be used to evaluate emission inventories. This study reports and compares CO2 fluxes measured directly using the eddy covariance (EC) method with emissions taken from the gridded local emissions inventory for the footprint covered by the EC flux system for a residential/commercial neighborhood of Mexico City. The flux measurements were conducted over 15-month period. No seasonal variability was found, but a clear diurnal pattern with morning and evening peaks in phase with the rush-hour traffic was observed. After adding contributions from human and soil respiration obtained by bottom-up approaches, and subtracting the CO2 sequestrated by vegetation calculated by applying biomass allometric equations and a growth predictive model to trees inventoried within the studied domain, results show that the current emissions inventory over-predicts 2.8 times the average daily flux measured on weekdays. Using traffic emissions data from a 2-year older inventory the difference decreased to 30%, suggesting that the traffic load for this part of the city is probably highly overestimated in the current emissions inventory. This study is expected to contribute to the verification capabilities of the GHG mitigation management of Mexico City, and to serve as a reference for other subtropical cities with similar urbanization patterns.

570,WOS:000399246100003,"Purpose As one of largest energy consumers, the transport sector (TS) has significant impacts on the environment. Shenzhen, a developed megacity in South China, plays a leadership role in promoting the development of energy efficient vehicles in China. Methods This paper aims to assess the carbon footprint (CF) of the TS in Shenzhen via a Streamlined Life Cycle Assessment method. Consequently, the current environmental performance of the TS is evaluated and improvement potentials are examined. Results and discussion The results show that CF has gained rapid growth over the past decade at an annual rate of 15.3 %, closely corresponding with the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (18.9 %) in Shenzhen. The total CF in 2013 was estimated as 50.7 million tons (ranging from 41.7 to 59.9). Road based freight transport accounts for the largest share of the TS' emissions. The most significant contributors in this sector are: light duty trucks, urban public transport bus service, and passenger air transport. Meanwhile, this study took new energy vehicles into consideration in order to explore the range of CF mitigation potential in Shenzhen. The potential carbon abatement is not significant in comparison with the impact growth derived from the increasing freight and passenger transport based on the assumption that the transport intensity and its annual growth rate maintain at the current levels. Conclusions This study offers a useful approach to evaluate the available options for sustainable transport system planning in Shenzhen. For carbon emissions reductions from the TS, policies and technological innovations are essential to facilitate the transition to a low carbon TS. In addition, the methodology developed in this study could be used for assessing CF in other sectors.","Duan, HB, Hu, MW, Zuo, J, Zhu, JS, Mao, RC, Huang, QF",1,Shenzhen,CHN,10.1007/s11367-016-1187-5,SRID=4326;POINT (114.0683 22.54554),10358381,"Assessing the carbon footprint of the transport sector in mega cities via streamlined life cycle assessment: a case study of Shenzhen, South China",2017

While the major impacts are from transport energy use and emissions, very few studies attempted to examine the impacts from transport infrastructure, especially at a city or country level. This paper, taking Shenzhen in China (a fast developing megacity) as the case study, is specially designed to quantify the carbon footprint of the urban roads by using streamlined life cycle assessment method. For given years (ranged from 2004 to 2013), various activities of urban roads (e.g. newly planned road construction, maintenance of road in use, and road renovation and demolition) have been examined in this study. The results show that the total carbon footprint from urban roads in Shenzhen was 260 (20) thousand tons CO(2)e in 2013. The major contributor was the materials use (embodied impact) from newly constructed roads, which accounts for 52.3% of the total carbon footprint, followed by the maintenance stage (243%). The eco-design process of road construction plays a vital role in achieving the effective carbon footprint reduction. These findings help to better understand the carbon footprint from urban roads in megacities, and provide useful inputs for policy making process in terms of identifying carbon reduction opportunities for the transport sector. In addition, the methodologies are useful for the quantification of carbon footprint in other cities of China and beyond. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As an energy-intense economic sector (Gossling, 2013), tourism is thus expected to play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions in China. However, low-carbon tourism in most destinations, and especially in newly emerging tourism destinations, is being neglected to some extent.

Towards achieving these policies, this study evaluated the energy efficiency potential in the city, in collaboration with the district heating and electricity utility Fortum. Drawing on their vast billing meter data on the housing stock in Stockholm, a new understanding of energy use in the city emerged. Analysis of the energy efficiency potential of different building vintages revealed that the retrofitting potential of the building stock to current building codes would reduce heating energy use by one third. In terms of market segmentation, the greatest reduction potential in total energy was found to be for buildings constructed between 1946 and 1975. This is due to the large number of buildings constructed during that era and their poor energy performance. However, the least energy-efficient buildings were those built between 1926 and 1945 in contradiction to commonly held beliefs. These findings indicate the need for a shift in public policy towards the buildings with highest retrofitting potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

578,WOS:000398334500011,"Many modern cities have strongly invested in the sustainability of their urban water management system. Nordic cities like Stockholm or Copenhagen are amongst pioneers in investments towards integrated urban water management. However, cities can never be fully self-sufficient due to their dependency on external (water) resources. In this paper, we quantify this water dependency with respect to food consumption in nine cities located in the five Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland), by means of the water footprint concept. Detailed urban water footprint assessments are scarce in the literature. By analysing national nutrition surveys, we find that urban food intake behaviour differs from national food intake behaviour. In large Nordic cities people eat generally less potatoes, milk products (without cheese), meat and animal fats and they drink less coffee than outside city borders. On the other hand, they generally eat more vegetables and vegetable oils and they drink more tea and alcoholic beverages. This leads consistently-for the six large Nordic cities Stockholm, Malmo, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo and Reykjavik-to slightly smaller food related urban water footprints (-2 to -6%) than national average values. We also analyse the water footprint for different diets based upon Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) for these cities. We assessed three healthy diet scenarios: 1) including meat (HEALTHY-MEAT), 2) pesco-vegetarian (HEALTHY-PESCO-VEG) and 3) vegetarian (HEALTHY-VEG). This shows that Nordic urban dwellers 1) eat too many animal products (red meat, milk and milk products) and sugar and drink too much alcohol and 2) they eat not enough vegetables, fruit and products from the group pulses, nuts and oilcrops. Their overall energy and protein intake is too high. A shift to a healthy diet with recommended energy and protein intake reduces the urban WF related to food consumption substantially. A shift to HEALTHY-MEAT results in a reduction of -9 to -24%, for HEALTHY-PESCO-VEG the reduction is -29 to -37%, for HEALTHY-VEG the reduction is -36 to -44%. In other words, Nordic urban dwellers can save a lot of water by shifting to a healthy diet. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although it is recognized that urban carbon governance occurs through diverse programs and projects-involving multiple actors and working through multiple sites, mechanisms, objects, and subjects-surprisingly little attention has been paid to the actual processes through which these diverse elements are drawn together and held together in the exercise of governing. These processes-termed configuration-remain underspecified. This article explores urban carbon governance interventions as relational configurations, excavating how their diverse elements-human, institutional, representational, and material- are assembled, drawn into relation, and held together in the exercise of governing. Through an analysis of two contrasting case studies of urban carbon governance interventions in Sydney, Australia, we draw out common processes of configuring and specific sets of devices and techniques that gather, align, and maintain the relations between actors and elements that constitute intervention projects. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of conceiving of governing projects as relational configurations for how we understand the nature and practice of urban carbon governance, especially by revealing the diverse modes of power at work within processes of configuring.","McGuirk, PM, Bulkeley, H, Dowling, R",2,Sydney,AUS,10.1080/00045608.2015.1084670,SRID=4326;POINT (151.20732 -33.86785),4627345,"Configuring Urban Carbon Governance: Insights from Sydney, Australia",2016

In this study, we examine the coupling of energy and carbon flows associated with cities. To do this, a time-series dataset of carbon and energy flows with 66 urban samples of various geographic and economic conditions is developed, dating back to 1865. We assess correlation between energy consumption and carbon emissions with consideration of urban size and population density. By focusing on Beijing and Issaquah as two case cities, we model the coupling of energy and carbon metabolism at urban scale from a network perspective. The energy-carbon nexus is evaluated for its impact on carbon intensities associated with economic sectors. We find energy-use and carbon emissions of 1865-2014 are strongly coupled, for both large and small cities of varying population densities. A closer look into the impact of the energy-carbon nexus on carbon intensities is important for emissions control. We suggest that more comprehensive and up-to-date monitoring of the nexus in urban energy and carbon flows be initiated immediately in order to search for ideal options of low-carbon pathways for cities at global scale.

The time-variant quantities are adopted to represent the dynamic passenger demands, with which passenger boarding, alighting and transferring process are taken into consideration for calculating total travel time and variation of in-service train mass. To effectively measure the total energy consumption, three parts of energy consumption are specified, including traction energy consumption, auxiliary energy consumption and usage of regenerative energy. In particular, the regenerative energy is allowable to simultaneously reuse by traction trains on the same line or in supply regions of different lines nearby the same transfer station. A compromise for service quality and energy consumption from the viewpoint of system optimization is especially proposed through adjusting headways in different lines. To effectively solve the proposed model, a tabu search algorithm is designed to obtain near-optimal timetables of the whole transit network. With the practical data of Line 5, Line 10 and Yizhuang Line in Beijing rail transit network, the effectiveness of this model and solution method is demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments.

While energy metabolism includes both direct and indirect consumptions among sectors, few researchers have studied indirect consumption due to a lack of data. In this study, we used input-output analysis to calculate the energy flows among directly linked sectors. Building on this, we used ecological network analysis to develop a model of urban energy flows and also account for energy consumption embodied by the flows among indirectly linked sectors (represented numerically as paths with a length of 2 or more). To illustrate the model, monetary input-output tables for Beijing from 2000 to 2010 were analyzed to determine the embodied energy consumption and associated carbon footprints of these sectors. This analysis reveals the environmental pressure based on the source (energy consumption) and sink (carbon footprint) values. Indirect consumption was Beijing's primary form, and the carbon footprint therefore resulted mainly from indirect consumption (both accounting for ca. 60% of the total, though with considerable variation among sectors). To reduce emissions, the utilization efficiency of indirect consumption must improve. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Through lanes in the middle are separated by landscaped medians from side access lanes for bicycles and slow-moving local traffic. Using a case study from Oregon's Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area, this project considers what could happen if cities built arterials as multiway boulevards. This interdisciplinary study, which included widespread stakeholder and public participation as well as detailed land use and transportation modeling, was instrumental in the Eugene Planning Commission's decision to endorse converting a portion of the arterial into a multiway boulevard. Although the case study arterial, with its existing bus rapid transit lanes, requires an unusually wide right-of-way, the results show that the arterial could better accommodate residential and mixed-use buildings at the edges if reconfigured as a multiway boulevard. Projected benefits include the possibility of supporting 8,400 dwelling units, reducing annual vehicle miles traveled by nearly 100 million miles (161 million km), and reducing annual carbon emissions by nearly 110 million Ib (50 million kg). Development along the boulevard can preserve up to 1,684) acres (680 ha) of farmland and lead to an annual transportation savings per household of about $1,500.

Heating and cooling energy consumption of different types of buildings during 1981-2010 in Tianjin city, was simulated by using TRNSYS software. Daily or hourly extreme energy consumption was determined by percentile methods, and the climate impact on extreme energy consumption was analyzed. The results showed that days of extreme heating consumption showed apparent decrease during the recent 30 years for residential and large venue buildings, whereas days of extreme cooling consumption increased in large venue building. No significant variations were found for the days of extreme energy consumption for commercial building, although a decreasing trend in extreme heating energy consumption. Daily extreme energy consumption for large venue building had no relationship with climate parameters, whereas extreme energy consumption for commercial and residential buildings was related to various climate parameters. Further multiple regression analysis suggested heating energy consumption for commercial building was affected by maximum temperature, dry bulb temperature, solar radiation and minimum temperature, which together can explain 71.5 % of the variation of the daily extreme heating energy consumption. The daily extreme cooling energy consumption for commercial building was only related to the wet bulb temperature (R-2= 0.382). The daily extreme heating energy consumption for residential building was affected by 4 climate parameters, but the dry bulb temperature had the main impact. The impacts of climate on hourly extreme heating energy consumption has a 1-3 hour delay in all three types of buildings, but no delay was found in the impacts of climate on hourly extreme cooling energy consumption for the selected buildings.","Li, MC, Shi, J, Guo, J, Cao, JF, Niu, JD, Xiong, MM",1,Tianjin,CHN,10.1371/journal.pone.0124413,SRID=4326;POINT (117.17667 39.14222),11090314,Climate Impacts on Extreme Energy Consumption of Different Types of Buildings,2015

In case studies, the same detached four-bedroom house built in accordance with R2000 standards is studied in five Canadian cities with different climate and electricity mix. Conventional energy systems and alternatives using three technologies, namely ground source heat pumps (GSHPs), photovoltaics, and energy-efficient appliances; and their combinations are investigated. The results show that Using a GSHP in Calgary may increase overall GHG emissions, as electricity to drive the pump is primarily produced in coal-fired power stations. Using photovoltaics to generate electricity from carbon-free sources or energy-efficient appliances to reduce electricity demands result in almost no GHG reductions in Montreal and Vancouver, where over 90% of electricity comes from hydro power. The results also show that the use of photovoltaics in combination with GSHPs in Ottawa and Toronto, or with energy-efficient appliances in Calgary, can lead to more GHG reductions, compared to the use of a single technology. As a result, while climate affects energy use to some degree, local sources of electricity may have a greater impact on overall GHG emissions, which is an important measure of environmental impacts.

Results from higher broad-scale vulnerability assessments are difficult to implement conceptually and technically at the local scale. We present a climate change vulnerability assessment approach at the city scale that considers three main components: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Indicators were assessed within each component and were combined using Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE). The standardisation of indicators under each component was conducted, along with weighting, at each level of the vulnerability assessment hierarchy. The vulnerability assessment approach was applied to an urban area in India; namely, Bangalore metropolitan area. The application of vulnerability assessment approach was demonstrated and a spatial assessment of climate change vulnerability patterns was presented. The spatial pattern of vulnerability identifies areas urgently requiring attention to adaptation action, while vulnerability assessment enables policy intervention and prioritization at local spatial scales.

As energy demands of the building and output power of the engine are functions of weather condition and solar irradiation flux, the benchmark building was considered to be located in five different cities in Iran with diverse climatic and solar irradiation conditions. The proposed solar dish Stirling micro-CHP system was analyzed based on 3E analysis. The 3E analysis evaluated primary energy saving analysis (energy analysis), carbon dioxide emission reduction (environmental analysis) and payback period for return of investment (economic analysis) and was compared to a reference building that utilized primary energy carriers for its demands. Three scenarios were considered for assessment and sizing the solar dish Stirling engine. In the first scenario, size of the solar dish Stirling engine was selected based on the lowest annual electric power demand while, in second, the highest annual electric power consumption was considered to specify size of the engine. In the third scenario, a solar dish Stirling engine with constant output capacity was considered for the five locations. It was shown that implementing the solar dish Stirling micro-CHP system had good potential in primary energy saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction in all scenarios and acceptable payback period for return of the investment in some scenarios.

The main purpose of Micro-TEM is to achieve an acceptable degree of accuracy as a surrogate model for predicting transportation emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) on limited-access highways as an alternative to using a traffic model and then integrating those results into an emissions model. Key parameters related to traffic (volume, truck percentage, speed limits), geometry (road grade), and environment (temperature) were selected for detailed evaluation. Estimating vehicle emissions on the basis of second-by-second vehicle operation created the opportunity to integrate a microscopic traffic simulation model, VISSIM, with the latest U.S. Environmental Protection Agency mobile source emissions model, the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), for higher precision and accuracy. The VISSIM MOVES integration software, VIMIS, was developed to facilitate running a multilevel factorial experiment on a test-bed prototype of an urban section of I-4, a limited-access highway in Orlando, Florida. The analysis identified the optimal settings for CO2 emissions reduction on the basis of two main parameters, traffic volume and speed. Volume correlation with CO2 emissions rates revealed an exponentially decaying function toward a limiting value expressed in the freeway capacity. Moreover, at speeds between 55 and 60 mph there was a significant reduction in the emissions rate, yet up to 90% of the freeway capacity was maintained. The results demonstrated that active speed management has a significant impact on CO2 emissions provided that a detailed and microscopic analysis of vehicle acceleration and deceleration has been conducted.

The study has considered five scenarios for the year 2021; one business as usual, and four future alternative scenarios, with. 2007 as the reference year. The alternative scenarios have been developed by considering the introduction of six policy interventions, namely; construction of integrated mass rapid transit system (IMRTS), fixed bus speed, hike in parking fees, fuel efficiency, stringent emission norms, and increase in the occupancy of private vehicles. An integrated Activity Structure-Energy Intensity-Fuel Mix (ASIF) framework has been used to model, energy demand and CO2 emissions. The outcome from the study shows that 2021-ALT-IV scenario gives the best-estimate results, which translated to similar to 32% reduction in annual energy demand than projected in 2021-BAU scenario. This reduces the daily per-capita energy requirement to 5.3 MJ in 2021-ALT-IV scenario, contributing to about 2.9 million tons of CO2 emissions.

A lifecycle analysis was performed on the basis of data from an on-farm AcoD in New York, resulting in a 71% reduction in GHG, or net reduction of 37.5 kg CO(2)e/t influent relative to conventional treatment of manure and food waste. Displacement of grid electricity provided the largest reduction, followed by avoidance of alternative food waste disposal options and reduced impacts associated with storage of digestate vs undigested manure. These reductions offset digester emissions and the net increase in emissions associated with land application in the AcoD case relative to the reference case. Sensitivity analysis showed that using feedstock diverted from high impact disposal pathways, control of digester emissions, and managing digestate storage emissions were opportunities to improve the AcoD GHG benefits. Regional and parametrized emissions factors for the storage emissions and land application phases would reduce uncertainty.","Ebner, JH, Labatut, RA, Rankin, MJ, Pronto, JL, Gooch, CA, Williamson, AA, Trabold, TA",12,New York City,USA,10.1021/acs.est.5b01331,SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),8175133,Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Analysis of an Anaerobic Codigestion Facility Processing Dairy Manure and Industrial Food Waste,2015

There may, however, be some tensions between such a compact urban developmental strategy and considerations of public health in urban planning. This paper reviews findings from international research on the relationships between urban form and health and illustrates some of these effects by comparing statistics on life expectancy and the frequency of heart attacks among inhabitants of different urban districts in the Norwegian capital Oslo. Since we have only had access to aggregate figures at the level of urban districts, the results must be interpreted with caution. The currently available results do, however, suggest that the densification strategies often recommended for reducing the ecological footprints of cities might be encumbered with some important drawbacks, seen from a public health perspective. Based on the findings, some dilemmas and perspectives for sustainability- and health-oriented urban planning are discussed.","Naess, P",7,Oslo,NOR,10.1080/09654313.2013.797383,SRID=4326;POINT (10.74609 59.91273),580000,"Urban Form, Sustainability and Health: The Case of Greater Oslo",2014
600,WOS:000380020600003,"In order to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of daylighting, an innovative parabolic trough solar lighting and thermal (PTL/T) system is designed and analyzed in this paper. Parabolic trough solar lighting and thermal system uses parabolic trough collector (PTC) controlled by two-axis solar tracking system as solar collector. The collected sunlight is split by a cold mirror into visible light and infrared. The visible light is reflected by cold mirror, re-concentrated by a second-stage Fresnel lens, and then delivered by plastic optical fiber to the buildings for daylighting. The infrared goes through cold mirror, reaches thermal system, and is used for heating generation. The basic structure of PTL/T was outlined and described. The dimension of fiber bundle and parabolic trough was chosen after an optimal analysis. The cost of illuminating unit area was expressed as a function of illumination space dimensions and critical components efficiency. A case study was conducted to get a specific optimized illumination area and PTC area for the first time. The optimized result is to use 8-m(2) PTC as collector to illuminate 500-m(2) office space. The total solar energy utilization efficiency is 39.4%, with the lighting efficiency of 16.3% and thermal efficiency of 23.1%. The maximum energy savings and simple payback period were calculated for 10 typical cities when applied in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The amounts of greenhouse gas-emission reductions were also calculated. The payback period in Sunbelt region is as low as less than 10 years like in Los Angeles. The results show the proposed PTL/T system is competitive compared with traditional solar energy systems.

It is found that the urban transport condition and CO2 emissions would be more serious with the growth of vehicle ownership and travel demand. Compared with the baseline do-nothing scenario, the CO2 emissions could be reduced from 3.8% to 24.3% in 2020 by various transport policies. And the policy of controlling the number of passenger cars which has been carried out in Beijing and followed by some cities could achieve good results, which may help to increase the proportion of public transit to 55.6% and reduce the CO2 emission by 18.3% compared with the baseline scenario in 2020.","Liu, S, Chen, SK, Liang, X, Mao, BH, Jia, SP",1,Beijing,CHN,10.1155/2014/323819,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,Analysis of Transport Policy Effect on CO2 Emissions Based on System Dynamics,2015

This combination of renewable energy passively adapts to pre-existing structures and exploits them to their full advantage. The working prototypes presented aim to introduce an element of multi-functionality to building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), creating systems which produce energy while meeting required needs and desirable features of urban buildings. We also explore the combination of wind energy and various energy efficiency initiatives with BIPV designs. Our energy efficiency initiatives include a new method of generating the perception of natural sunlight from artificial light and brainwave controlled lighting that dims automatically when occupants' concentration is lowered. These efforts result in an environment that celebrates the existential notion of self-empowerment through reducing energy consumption and having control over one's own energy production. Our discussion follows into market considerations of our BIPV designs and how project costs are lowered and space is conserved, assets when designing for urban locations.

For different socioeconomic groups, cooling devices also deliver social and cultural services, such as socializing or adhering to Western fashion trends. This article argues for the need to address these aspects if reductions in household energy usage are to become possible.

605,WOS:000289394900004,"Since the 1990s, the capital city of Thailand, Bangkok has been suffering from severe ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution mainly attributable to its wide use of diesel-fueled vehicles and motorcycles with poor emission performance. While the Thai government strives to reduce emissions from transportation through enforcing policy measures, the link between specific control policies and associated health impacts is inadequately studied. This link is especially important in exploring the co-benefits of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, which often brings reduction in other pollutants such as PM. This paper quantifies the health benefits potentially achieved by the new PM-related I/M programs targeting all diesel vehicles and motorcycles in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA). The benefits are estimated by using a framework that integrates policy scenario development, exposure assessment, exposure-response assessment and economic valuation. The results indicate that the total health damage due to the year 2000 PM emissions from vehicles in the BMA was equivalent to 2.4% of Thailand's GDP. Under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, total vehicular PM emissions in the BMA will increase considerably over time due to the rapid growth in vehicle population, even if the fleet average emission rates are projected to decrease over time as the result of participation of Thailand in post-Copenhagen climate change strategies. By 2015, the total health damage is estimated to increase by 2.5 times relative to the year 2000. However, control policies targeting PM emissions from automobiles, such as the PM-oriented I/M programs, could yield substantial health benefits relative to the BAU scenario, and serve as co-benefits of greenhouse gas control strategies. Despite uncertainty associated with the key assumptions used to estimate benefits, we find that with a high level confidence, the I/M programs will produce health benefits whose economic impacts considerably outweigh the expenditures on policy implementation.

The Environment Protection Act (EPA) 1986 was enacted to implement India's commitments as a signatory. The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification of 1991 was made under the provisions of the EPA in order to protect coastal environments and social and livelihood security of fishing community. This paper assesses the effects of CRZ rules and violations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which has experienced tremendous growth due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization. This process has led to the destruction of mangroves and other important species of fish which play a crucial role in sustaining the coastal ecology and urban biodiversity; high population density and uneven growth have exacerbated adverse environmental and socioeconomic consequences. The Koli (fishing community) in this region faces huge problems of survival and sustenance in small-scale fishing, due to the rampant commercial fishing by big trawlers and large-scale dumping of waste materials by the industries surrounding the vicinity into the sea. In small but significant ways, the fishing communities through their traditional commons-based resource management and livelihood systems protect the coastal ecology and help the cities in reducing their carbon footprints. On the basis of primary field research in Thane-Mulund Creek Bhandup, Chimbai, and Sewri, this paper attempts to assess CRZ violations taking place on coastal areas and is causing damage to the coastal ecology. The research specifically has focused on the particular fishing-related activities and spaces-such as: jetties, parking of boats, access to sea, weaving and drying of nets, landing grounds, drying and cleaning of fish that are more affected by encroachment of seashore area and by CRZ rules violations.

In doing so the focus of the value proposition shifts from selling a physical product to providing access to functionality through business innovation. One key factor related to circular business transitions is market acceptance. It is particularly challenging to understand what complexity a new concept like circular economy (CE) brings to established businesses where the success and the failure of the business is dependent on customer's acceptance of new value propositions. Purpose: This paper empirically explores the opportunities of a circular business approach for washing machines in the city of Stockholm by quantifying and assessing customer preferences for CE value propositions for a business to customer (B2C) scenario.

Originality: This paper is the first of its kind to assess customer preferences from the CE market acceptance point of view using a conjoint approach and provides insight to what extent new CE value propositions may be adopted. Findings: Results indicate that there is general interest in paying for access rather than for ownership. Service levels have the strongest impact on customer utility of a washing machine offer. If associated with reduction in CO2 emissions the number of remanufacturing cycles can increase purchase probability. As a method choice-based conjoint analysis is highlighted as beneficial to break down CE value propositions and to identify to what extent particular service-related attributes and product-related attributes contribute to overall customer utility.

618,WOS:000313845500001,"Natural gas is the largest source of anthropogenic emissions of methane (CH4) in the United States. To assess pipeline emissions across a major city, we mapped CH4 leaks across all 785 road miles in the city of Boston using a cavity-ring-down mobile CH4 analyzer. We identified 3356 CH4 leaks with concentrations exceeding up to 15 times the global background level. Separately, we measured delta(CH4)-C-13 isotopic signatures from a subset of these leaks. The delta(CH4)-C-13 signatures (mean = -42.8 parts per thousand +/- 13 parts per thousand s.e.; n = 32) strongly indicate a fossil fuel source rather than a biogenic source for most of the leaks; natural gas sampled across the city had average delta(CH4)-C-13 values of -36.8 parts per thousand (+/- 0.7 parts per thousand. s.e., n = 10), whereas CH4 collected from landfill sites, wetlands, and sewer systems had delta(CH4)-C-13 signatures similar to 20 parts per thousand lighter (mu = -57.8 parts per thousand,+/- 1.6 parts per thousand s.e., n = 8). Repairing leaky natural gas distribution systems will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase consumer health and safety, and save money. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

With the end of the cold war, job reductions of DOE contractor workforce have severely impacted these regions. DOE worker separation policies may cushion or intensify these impacts. Using an economic simulation model, we examined the impacts of three different worker separation policies: the 'painful response' (no severance packages), the 'current response' (the current average of DO E separation packages), and the 'supportive response' (more lucrative severance and continued medical coverage). The analysis is split on two regional axes: (1) more rural DOE regions, as in the area surrounding the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Augusta, GA; versus (2) more metropolitan locations, such as the area surrounding the Rocky Flats Site which is in the Denver MSA. The results indicate that recent legislation which enhances worker separation packages for nuclear 'defence workers will substantially help the workers and their DOE-dependent communities cope with the negative impacts of DOE restructuring.

620,WOS:000357998100004,"The interaction of global climate change and urban heat islands (UHI) is expected to have far-reaching impacts on the sustainability of the world's rapidly growing urban population centers. Given that a wide range of spatiotemporal scales contributed by meteorological forcing and complex surface heterogeneity complicates UHI, a multimodel nested approach is used in this paper to study climate-change impacts on the Chicago, Illinois, UHI, covering a range of relevant scales. One-way dynamical downscaling is used with a model chain consisting of global climate (Community Atmosphere Model), regional climate (Weather Research and Forecasting Model), and microscale (""ENVI-met"") models. Nested mesoscale and microscale models are evaluated against the present-day observations (including a dedicated urban miniature field study), and the results favorably demonstrate the fidelity of the downscaling techniques that were used. A simple building-energy model is developed and used in conjunction with microscale-model output to calculate future energy demands for a building, and a substantial increase (as much as 26% during daytime) is noted for future (~2080) climate. Although winds and lake-breeze circulation for future climate are favorable for reducing energy usage by 7%, the benefits are outweighed by such factors as exacerbated UHI and air temperature. An adverse change in human-comfort indicators is also noted in the future climate, with 92% of the population experiencing thermal discomfort.

621,WOS:000350525300004,"Fuelled by a rapidly rising human global population, an increasing demand for freedom to travel and the affordability made possible by modern manufacturing there has been an exponential rise in the number of automobiles in the year 2013 there were in excess of a billion automobiles in use! Three factors that are of serious concern are the consequential energetic, environmental and economic impacts. One solution that is being seen by a number of national governments is the advent (or rather re-introduction) of electric vehicles (EVs). However, one of the key factors that will need to be explored will be the source of the required electricity for the EVs that will define the level of their sustainability. In this article an experimental evaluation of an electric vehicle has been undertaken. The Renault Zoe e-car has been used for this task with the 'car chasing' technique employed to measure the driving cycle. The speed and energy use were recorded for the vehicle that was driven along the principal arteries of the City of Edinburgh, Scotland. In a separate activity vehicle driving tests were also undertaken in one town in Slovenia (Celje). In both places urban and suburban routes were covered for different times of the day. Results are presented to quantify the energetic, environmental and economic performance indices for the driven vehicle. A discussion is also provided on the potential for reduction of carbon emissions from the transport sector by provision of environmentally-friendly means of generating electricity.

622,WOS:000376790400001,"Due to enhanced economic production as well as incentivized demanding supply management (DSM) strategies, solar photovoltaics (SPV) have experienced a phenomenal global annual growth rate but with a very limited contribution from the personal consumption sector, especially that of on-grid decentralized SPV. One of the reasons for this lies in the difficulties involved in unlocking the traditional production paradigm and lifestyle, based on centuries of conventional fossil-energy consumption. In response, this paper examines the case of Nine Dream Island in Nanjing, China, a pioneer of post-fossil emerging power supply communities providing on-grid SPV, to reveal the obstacles that lie beyond technological and economic factors involved. Empirical data including in-depth interviews illustrate the politico economic strategies of these communities in creating a new post-fossil production and consumption paradigm. In particular, it is suggested that, despite the National Development and Reform Commission's economic driving force in the form of 0.42 (sic)/kW h state subsidies in Nanjing, the complex pattern of governance structures and institutional arrangement characteristics overwhelmingly impedes public acceptance of a low-carbon model of production and consumption. Overall, the paper helps to shed light on the development and adoption of SPV as a post-fossil consumption and production technology in new market countries where administration forces provide a more important role in creating a new path-dependence for the adaptation of innovation technologies.

We examined forest owners' willingness to enroll in payments for carbon sequestration policies under different levels of financial incentives (annual revenue), different contract lengths, and different program administrators (e.g., private companies versus a state or federal agency). We also examined the influence forest owners' sense of place had on their willingness to enroll in hypothetical programs. Our results showed a high level of ambivalence toward participating in payments for carbon sequestration programs. However, both financial incentives and contract lengths significantly influenced forest owners' intent to enroll. Neither program administration nor forest owners' sense of place influenced intent to enroll.

More precisely, we compare the effects of the 'direct tool' of carbon tax, to a combination of 'indirect tools' - not originally aimed at reducing CO2 (i.e. congestion charging, parking charges and a reduction in public transport travel time) in terms of CO2 impacts through a change in the modal split. In our model, modal choices depend on individual characteristics, trip features (including the effects of policy tools), and land use at origin and destination zones. Personal ""CO2 emissions budgets"" resulting from the trips observed in the, metropolitan area of Lille (France) in 2006 are calculated and compared to the situation related to the different policy scenarios. We find that an increase of 50% in parking charges combined with a cordon toll of (sic)1.20 and a 10% travel time decrease in public transport services (made after recycling toll-revenues) is the winning scenario. The combined effects of all the policy scenarios are superior to their separate effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

625,WOS:000227005800003,"An on-site generator, such as CGS (cogeneration system), is considered to be an effective end-use energy system in order to accomplish primary energy conservation, CO2 emissions mitigation, and system cost reduction; these characteristics will eventually improve the complete performance of an existing energy system in the future. Considering the drawback of installing an end-use CGS for a customer possessing small or middle-scale floor space, however, it is difficult to achieve those distinctive features because the thermal-electricity ratio of CGS is not always in agreement with that of customer energy demand. In order to overcome that matching deficiency, it is better to organize an on-site generator network based on mutual electricity and heating transmission. But focusing on some cogenerators underlying their behaviors regarding maximizing their own profits, this on-site network, whose situation corresponds to a grand coalition, is not necessarily established because of each cogenerator's motivation to form a partial coalition and acquire its own profit as much as possible. In this paper, we attempt to analyze the optimal operation of an on-site generator network and identify by applying the nucleolus of cooperative game theory the optimal benefit allocation strategy in order for the cogenerators to construct the network. Regarding the installation site of this network, the center of Tokyo city is assumed; the locational information includes floor space and so forth through a GIS (geographic information system) database. The results from the nucleolus suggest that all districts should impartially obtain benefit from organizing the network for the purpose of jointly attaining system total cost reduction.

627,WOS:000244589500008,"Since the Kyoto protocol signed in December 1997 the majority of governments around the world have committed themselves to reducing the emission of the greenhouse gases. Thus, efficient use of energy and sustainability has become a key issue for the most energy policies. Sustainability and energy saving terms take place in building construction industry too since buildings are one of the most significant energy consumers. It is known that heating energy demand of a building has a great rate in building total energy consumption. In addition to that, the most of the heating energy has been lost from building envelope. TS 825, Heating Energy Conservation Standard for Buildings in Turkey, aims the reducing of heat loss in buildings through the envelope. But within buildings, one of the fastest growing sources of new energy demand is cooling and especially in hot-humid and hot-dry climatic parts of Turkey cooling season is much longer than the heating season. Moreover in hot-dry climate heat storage capacity of the envelope becomes more important issue than heat insulation for energy efficiency of the building. Since the Turkish standard is considering only heating energy conservation by using degree-day concept, Istanbul and Mardin are considered in the same zone, however those are in temperate-humid and hot-dry climatic zones, respectively. In this study energy efficient design strategies for these climatic zones have been explained and thermal performance of two buildings, which are constructed according to the TS 825 in Mardin and Istanbul cities were evaluated to show the importance of thermal mass in hot-dry climates.

Findings indicate a range of policies with potential to reduce emissions in the period up to 2050.

629,WOS:000338615500005,"This study presents the results of a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) on the energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission implications of recycling construction and demolition (C&D) rubble and container glass in Cape Town, South Africa. Cape Town is a medium sized city in a developing country with a growing population and a rising middle class, two factors that are resulting in increased generation of solid waste. The City is constrained in terms of landfill space and competing demands for municipal resources. The LCA assessment was based on locally gathered data, supplemented with ecoinvent life cycle inventory data modified to the local context. The results indicated that recycling container glass instead of landfilling can achieve an energy savings of 27% and a GHG emissions savings of 37%, with a net savings still being achieved even if collection practices are varied. The C&D waste results, however, showed net savings only for certain recycling strategies. Recycling C&D waste can avoid up to 90% of the energy and GHG emissions of landfilling when processed and reused onsite but, due to great dependence on haulage distances, a net reduction of energy use and GHG emissions could not be confidently discerned for off-site recycling. It was also found that recycling glass achieves significantly greater savings of energy and emissions than recycling an equivalent mass of C&D waste. The study demonstrated that LCA provides an important tool to inform decisions on supporting recycling activities where resources are limited. It also confirmed other researchers' observations that strict adherence to the waste management hierarchy will not always result in the best environmental outcome, and that more nuanced analysis is required. The study found that the desirability of recycling from an energy and climate perspective cannot be predicted on the basis of whether such recycling conserves a non-renewable material. However, recycling that replaces a virgin product from an energy-intensive production process appears to be more robustly beneficial than recycling that replaces a product with little embodied energy. Particular caution is needed when applying the waste management hierarchy to the latter situations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

630,WOS:000325989100003,"There is universal agreement between the United Nations and governments from the richest to the poorest nations that humanity faces unprecedented global challenges relating to sustainable energy, clean water, low-emission transportation, coping with climate change and natural disasters, and reclaiming use of land. We have invited researchers from a range of eclectic research areas to provide a Roadmap of how superconducting technologies could address these major challenges confronting humanity. Superconductivity has, over the century since its discovery by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, promised to provide solutions to many challenges. So far, most superconducting technologies are esoteric systems that are used in laboratories and hospitals. Large science projects have long appreciated the ability of superconductivity to efficiently create high magnetic fields that are otherwise very costly to achieve with ordinary materials. The most successful applications outside of large science are high-field magnets for magnetic resonance imaging, laboratory magnetometers for mineral and materials characterization, filters for mobile communications, and magnetoencephalography for understanding the human brain. The stage is now set for superconductivity to make more general contributions. Humanity uses practically unthinkable amounts of energy to drive our modern way of life. Overall, global power usage has been predicted to almost double from 16.5 to 30 TW in the next four decades (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources). The economy with which electrons carry energy compels the continued quest for efficient superconducting power generation, energy storage, and power transmission. The growing global population requires new arable land and treatment of water, especially in remote areas, and superconductivity offers unique solutions to these problems. Exquisite detectors give warning of changes that are otherwise invisible. Prediction of climate and disasters will be helped by future supercomputer technologies that support huge amounts of data and sophisticated modeling, and with the aid of superconductivity these systems might not require the energy of a large city. We present different sections on applications that could address (or are addressing) a range of environmental issues. The Roadmap covers water purification, power distribution and storage, low-environmental impact transport, environmental sensing (particularly for the removal of unexploded munitions), monitoring the Earth's magnetic fields for earthquakes and major solar activity, and, finally, developing a petaflop supercomputer that only requires 3% of the current supercomputer power provision while being 50 times faster. Access to fresh water. With only 2.5% of the water on Earth being fresh and climate change modeling forecasting that many areas will become drier, the ability to recycle water and achieve compact water recycling systems for sewage or ground water treatment is critical. The first section (by Nishijima) points to the potential of superconducting magnetic separation to enable water recycling and reuse. Energy. The Equinox Summit held in Waterloo Canada 2011 (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources) identified electricity use as humanity's largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Our appetite for electricity is growing faster than for any other form of energy. The communique from the summit said 'Transforming the ways we generate, distribute and store electricity is among the most pressing challenges facing society today .... If we want to stabilize CO2 levels in our atmosphere at 550 parts per million, all of that growth needs to be met by non-carbon forms of energy' (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources). Superconducting technologies can provide the energy efficiencies to achieve, in the European Union alone, 33-65% of the required reduction in greenhouse gas emissions according to the Kyoto Protocol (Hartikainen et al 2003 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 16 963). New technologies would include superconducting energy storage systems to effectively store power generation from renewable sources as well as high-temperature superconducting systems used in generators, transformers and synchronous motors in power stations and heavy-industry facilities. However, to be effective, these systems must be superior to conventional systems and, in reality, market penetration will occur as existing electrical machinery is written off. At current write-off rates, to achieve a 50% transfer to superconducting systems will take 20 years (Hartikainen et al 2003 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 16 963). The Roadmap next considers dc transmission of green power with a section by Eckroad and Marian who provide an update on the development of superconducting power transmission lines in view of recent sustainability studies. The potential of magnetic energy storage is then presented by Coi and Kim, who argue that a successful transition to wind and solar power generation must be harmonized with the conventional electrical network, which requires a storage technology with a fast response and long backup times. Transport. Superconducting Maglev trains and motors for international shipping have the potential to considerably reduce the emissions that contribute to greenhouse gases while improving their economic viability by reducing losses and improving efficiencies. International shipping, alone, contributes 3% of the greenhouse gas emissions. Three sections of the Roadmap identify how high-speed rail can be a major solution to providing fast, low energy, environmentally-friendly transport enabling reduction in automobile and aircraft travel by offering an alternative that is very competitive. With maritime international environmental regulations tightening, HTS motors with the characteristics of high torque and compactness will become important devices for high-performance and low-emission electric ship propulsion systems. A section on the development of a megawatt-class superconducting motor for ship propulsion is presented by Umemoto. Monitoring in manufacturing for waste reduction. Environmental impact from the waste created by the manufacturing sector and the need to make manufacturing efficient can be addressed by terahertz imaging. This technology has great potential in non-destructive testing, industrial process monitoring and control to greatly improve the industry process efficiency and reliability by reducing waste materials and toxic by-products. The section by Du shows how terahertz imaging can provide process and property information such as rust levels under paint that can assist with the reduction of waste in manufacturing and maintenance. Monitoring for naturally occurring disturbances. The environmental and social impact of natural disasters is mounting. Febvre provides the Roadmap for the use of ultra-sensitive magnetometry to understand geomagnetic phenomena and Earth-ionosphere couplings through the study of very small variations of the magnetic field. This magnetic monitoring has many implications for understanding our environment and providing new tools for early warning of natural hazards, either on Earth or in space which will enable us to be better prepared for natural disasters. Restoring environments after military use. Throughout the world, there are many areas confirmed or suspected of being contaminated by unexploded munitions known as unexploded ordnance (UXO). Its presence is the result of wars and training of military forces. Areas affected by UXO contamination are hazardous to the public and have a major influence on the nature of land use. UXO has impact in developed as well as developing nations. For example, the USA has UXO dating back to the American Civil War and countries such as Cambodia are living with landmines as a daily issue due to more recent wars. Underwater UXO has caused severe impacts such as the explosion in 1969 in the waters of Kent in the UK that caused a reading of 4.5 on the Richter scale for earthquake monitors. Another example was a land-based detonation of a 500 kg World War II bomb in Germany killing three people in 2010. There is countless UXO from recent conflicts worldwide. Detection and accurate location with 100% reliability is required to return land to safe civilian use. Keenan provides details of a prototype magnetic gradiometer developed for this purpose. Reducing power needs for high-end IT. Supercomputers are so large that they are close to requiring their own small power plant to support the energy needed to run the computer. For example, in 2011 Facebook data centers and operations used 532 million kW hours of energy. Mukhanov explores the potential of reducing the power dissipation for future supercomputers from more than 500 MW for Exascale systems to 0.2 MW by using superconducting-ferromagnetic Josephson junctions for magnetic memory and programmable logic. Clearly superconductivity is an ultimate energy-saving technology, and its practical implementation will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions, improved water purification, reduction of waste and timely preparedness for natural disasters or significant events. This Roadmap shows how the application of superconducting technologies will have a significant impact when they are adopted.","Nishijima, S, Eckroad, S, Marian, A, Choi, K, Kim, WS, Terai, M, Deng, ZG, Zheng, J, Wang, JS, Umemoto, K, Du, J, Febvre, P, Keenan, S, Mukhanov, O, Cooley, LD, Foley, CP, Hassenzahl, WV, Izumi, M",50,Kent,USA,10.1088/0953-2048/26/11/113001,SRID=4326;POINT (-122.23484 47.38093),126952,Superconductivity and the environment: a Roadmap,2013

632,WOS:000376444300003,"Countless cities are rapidly developing across the globe, pressing the need for clear urban-planning and design recommendations geared toward sustainability. This paper examines the intersections of Jane Jacobs' four conditions for diversity with low-carbon and low-energy-use urban systems in four cities around the world: Lyon (France), Chicago (Illinois), Kolkata (India), and Singapore City (Singapore). After reviewing Jacobs' four conditions for diversity, the four cities are introduced and their historical development context is described. A framework to study the cities along the following three dimensions is then presented: population and density, infrastructure development/use, and climate and landscape. These cities differ in many respects and their analysis is instructive for many other cities around the globe. Jacobs' conditions are present in all of them, manifested in different ways and to varying degrees. Overall, the study results show that the adoption of Jacobs' conditions seems to align well with concepts of low-carbon urban systems, with their focus on walkability, transit-oriented design, and more efficient land use (i.e., smaller unit sizes). Transportation-sector emissions seem to demonstrate a stronger influence from the presence of Jacobs' conditions, whereas the link was less pronounced in the building sector. Kolkata, a low-income, developing world city, seems to possess many of Jacobs' conditions, while exhibiting low per-capita emissions-maintaining both of these during its economic expansion will take careful consideration.

Empirical accounts reveal how difficult such coordination often is due to contradictory views involved. How can we better understand related processes of searching and negotiation? What does this mean for the organization of decision making processes regarding long-term infrastructural change? We analyze a conflict which erupted in Freiburg, Germany when two strategies of reducing environmental impacts of space heating were to be applied in the Vauban 'model district': A) Efficient co-generation of heat and power (CHP) combined with district heating systems (DHS), and B) Reducing heat demand by low-energy designs and ambitious energy standards ('passive house standard'). In order to understand the politics of infrastructure development, we unravel 1) enabling factors and driving forces of the conflict, 2) normative content of opposing viewpoints, 3) resources tapped into for settling the disagreement, and 4) the institutional setup of such decision making about energy policy priorities in the municipality. We reflect on implications of such a perspective on how policies and how governance arrangements should ideally be shaped and take a brief outlook on further research needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although recently developed remote sensing techniques provide necessary city-wide information, a sufficient and consistent city-wide information of relevant urban ecosystem services, such as carbon emissions offset, does not exist. This study uses city-wide, high-resolution, and remotely sensed data to derive individual tree species information and to estimate the above-ground carbon storage of urban forests in Berlin, Germany. The variance of tree biomass was estimated using allometric equations that contained different levels of detail regarding the tree species found in this study of 700 km(2), which had a tree canopy of 213 km(2). The average tree density was 65 trees/ha per unit of tree cover and a range from 10 to 40 trees/ha for densely urban land cover. City-wide estimates of the above-ground carbon storage ranged between 6.34 and 7.69 tC/ha per unit of land cover, depending on the level of tree species information used. Equations that did not use individually localized tree species information undervalued the total amount of urban forest carbon storage by up to 15 %. Equations using a generalized estimate of dominant tree species information provided rather precise city-wide carbon estimates. Concerning differences within a densely built area per unit of land cover approaches using individually localized tree species information prevented underestimation of mid-range carbon density areas (10-20 tC/ha), which were actually up to 8.4 % higher, and prevented overestimation of very low carbon density areas (0-5 tC/ha), which were actually up to 11.4 % lower. Park-like areas showed 10 to 30 tC/ha, whereas land cover of very high carbon density (40-80 tC/ha) mostly consisted of mixed peri-urban forest stands. Thus, this approach, which uses widely accessible and remotely sensed data, can help to improve the consistency of forest carbon estimates in cities.","Tigges, J, Churkina, G, Churkina, G, Lakes, T",0,Berlin,DEU,10.1007/s11252-016-0585-6,SRID=4326;POINT (13.41053 52.52437),3426354,Modeling above-ground carbon storage: a remote sensing approach to derive individual tree species information in urban settings,2017

However, we consider that cities will be at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technologies and policies, as evidenced in the initiatives taken by many cities here and worldwide to resolve issues in energy and climate change. In addition to affording energy and environmental benefits, investments in energy efficient and renewable technologies have huge potential to boost local economies, as demonstrated by the recent federal allocation of stimulus funding. Inclined to give priority to stopgap measures, many cities tend to regard comprehensive long-term planning as secondary. However, such solutions would bring multiple benefits to the community.

The policies analyzed include both pricing policies aimed to increase car costs and fleet renovation. The study applies a land-use and transportation interaction model combined with an optimization algorithm that provides the optimal design of each policy. The results show how each policy, or combination of policies, affects long-term modal share, trip length, trip times, and vehicle kilometers traveled. Those are the explanatory variables for modeling the emissions at a city level. The policies are tested in the metropolitan area of Madrid (Spain). The evaluation framework allows testing the effectiveness of these policies for various future policy measures at two different geographical scales. The impact of a fuel tax and a major vehicle fleet renewal are simulated for the whole Madrid region. Policy packages including a congestion (road) charge and increased parking fees are tested only in the central business district of the city. The results of the study show that of all the policy packages tested involving higher fuel prices are expected to have the greatest effect on achieving the environmental targets. They also show that technological improvements in the vehicle fleet are insufficient to reduce CO2 emissions levels per se, although they do contribute to a decrease in pollutant emissions owing to improved engine performance and reduced gas consumption and emissions when used together with other policy instruments. Finally, local measures such as road pricing and parking fees fulfill local objectives in the central area of the city but cause negative externalities on the surrounding areas.","Guzman, LA, de la Hoz, D, Monzon, A",4,Madrid,ESP,10.1080/15568318.2015.1033039,SRID=4326;POINT (-3.70256 40.4165),3255944,Optimization of transport measures to reduce GHG and pollutant emissions through a LUTI modeling approach,2016

With the continued extraction of bitumen-rich material from Alberta's oil sands project, there is an opportunity to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of upgrading and refining operations by using electrolytically produced hydrogen in place of hydrogen produced by steam methane reformation. Recently, a bitumen upgrading facility had been proposed for the city of Sarnia, Ontario because of its pre-existing petroleum processing infrastructure. Using the Ontario electrical system, which has a lower emissions factor than Alberta, the use of electrolytic hydrogen could result in a significant reduction of greenhouse gasses. In this paper, the objective is to determine an optimal system configuration for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining a low system cost. The analysis is performed with General Algebraic Modelling System tool, a mixed-integer linear optimization in addition to a simple model in Visual Basic.

642,WOS:000424186600079,"This paper investigates the environmental benefits of ride-sharing through its CO2 emission mitigation potential. Ride-sharing is expected to substantially decrease CO2 emissions by raising vehicle occupancy, thus mechanically reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Yet, as ride-sharing entails both a decrease in travel (monetary) costs and in travel times (inasmuch as it reduces road congestion), it is likely to make the car more attractive ultimately. This could result in mode switching in the short run (as travelers forsake public transport or active modes for car), as well as in longer distances travelled in the medium run. In the long run, people could even take advantage of the easier travel conditions to relocate further within the metropolitan area. To account for these rebound effects, we develop an integrated land-use transport model. This intends to capture the effects of ride-sharing on the whole household decision process regarding transport and residential location. The model is applied to the Paris region, with several ride-sharing scenarios for year 2030. While ride-sharing does indeed strongly reduce CO2 emissions, we find substantial rebound mechanisms. In contrast to the (naive) expectation that raising vehicle occupancy by 50% would reduce CO2 emissions by 33%, the various rebound effects end up dividing the CO2 emission savings by a factor ranging from 2 to 3 depending on the day period considered (i.e. the morning or evening peak period). The rebound mechanisms - the mode switching, distance and relocation effects - should therefore be heeded. Some policy recommendations are provided to develop ride-sharing while curbing these unintended effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, calculated energy losses were reduced by 8%. The covering was more effective on cold days, but at temperatures above 12.2 degrees C the ivy covering increased energy loss, because it shaded the outside of the wall from warming by short wave radiation.

Consumer decisions to purchase these technologies are also influenced by several complex criteria such as costs/benefits, performance, appeal/status, risk, psychographics, and demographics. This complexity motivated the development of an innovative diffusion model, incorporating features of multi-criteria analysis and choice modelling, to estimate the adoption of these technology options spatially across the landscape of heterogeneous consumers. We test the model to forecast market share of EVs through to 2030, using the vehicle stock across all 1.5 million households in Victoria, Australia. Seven financial and non-financial criteria were included and calibrated via focus groups and a large-scale survey. Annual change of criteria values and their elasticity to adoption were incorporated. Geographical differences in uptake of EVs were primarily due to driving distance, employment status and household income, with urban areas having about three times the proportional uptake.

As a C4 crop, maize photosynthesis is already CO2-saturated at current CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) and the primary response of maize to elevated [CO2] is decreased stomatal conductance (gs). If maize photosynthesis is not stimulated in elevated [CO2], then reduced gs is not offset by greater canopy leaf area, which could potentially result in a greater ET reduction relative to that previously reported in soybean, a C3 species. The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of elevated [CO2] on canopy energy and water fluxes of maize (Zea mays). Maize was grown under ambient and elevated [CO2] (550molmol1 during 2004 and 2006 and 585molmol1 during 2010) using Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE) technology at the SoyFACE facility in Urbana, Illinois. Maize ET was determined using a residual energy balance approach based on measurements of sensible (H) and soil heat fluxes, and net radiation. Relative to control, elevated [CO2] decreased maize ET (711%; P<0.01) along with lesser soil moisture depletion, while H increased (2530Wm2; P<0.01) along with higher canopy temperature (0.50.6 degrees C). This reduction in maize ET in elevated [CO2] is approximately half that previously reported for soybean. A partitioning analysis showed that transpiration contributed less to total ET for maize compared to soybean, indicating a smaller role of stomata in dictating the ET response to elevated [CO2]. Nonetheless, both maize and soybean had significantly decreased ET and increased H, highlighting the critical role of elevated [CO2] in altering future hydrology and climate of the region that is extensively cropped with these species.","Hussain, MZ, Vanloocke, A, Siebers, MH, Ruiz-Vera, UM, Markelz, RJC, Leakey, ADB, Ort, DR, Bernacchi, CJ",28,Urbana,USA,10.1111/gcb.12155,SRID=4326;POINT (-88.20726999999999 40.11059),42311,Future carbon dioxide concentration decreases canopy evapotranspiration and soil water depletion by field-grown maize,2013

The study includes both peer-reviewed and grey literature (274 literature sources), and synthesizes evidence and agreement on both UPAF's potential and limitations for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Eight East and West African cities were included in the review: Accra, Addis Ababa, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Douala, Kampala, Ibadan and Nairobi. The review focuses on urban livelihoods, ecosystem services and urban policy responses as pathways to mediating climate change. Literature on UPAF indicates emerging consensus on the potential of UPAF in adaptation, but less agreement with respect to mitigation of climate change. African cities are implementing several measures including UPAF to address issues of development, reduce inequality and move towards low emissions development strategies. This calls for integrated urban development that supports green growth to harness economic opportunities with social and environmental benefits. The review reveals that through UPAF, the potential for mitigation and adaptation of climate change can address some development deficit issues and transform institutions at the city-regional level by leveraging good UPAF practices.","Lwasa, S, Mugagga, F, Wahab, B, Simon, D, Connors, JP, Griffith, C",6,Douala; Addis Ababa; Dakar; Accra; Kampala; Ibadan; Nairobi,CMR; ETH; SEN; GHA; UGA; NGA; KEN,10.1016/j.cosust.2015.02.003,SRID=4326;POINT (9.704280000000001 4.04827); SRID=4326;POINT (38.74689 9.02497); SRID=4326;POINT (-17.44406 14.6937); SRID=4326;POINT (-0.1969 5.55602); SRID=4326;POINT (32.58219 0.31628); SRID=4326;POINT (3.90591 7.37756); SRID=4326;POINT (36.81667 -1.28333),1338082; 2757729; 2476400; 1963264; 1353189; 3565108; 2750547,A meta-analysis of urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry in mediating climate change,2015

Many and diverse actors with contrasting interests interact in urban sustainability transitions. Their perceptions and values impact the potential uptake of transition strategies in urban systems. It is thus important to understand how actors view themselves involved in such processes. A case study on low carbon transitions for the city of Bilbao (Basque Country) is presented to explore the barriers and opportunities for an energy transition using Q methodology. Results suggest that stakeholders' motivation and perceived capacity for change are mainly related to four main discourses: follower, visionary, pragmatist and sceptic. Results also indicate that information exchange, communication and participation in decision-making processes, bridging visionaries and pragmatists with decision-makers, are key for bringing about effective transition processes. This study contributes to identifying attitudes of actors who can negotiate urban low-carbon transitions and stresses the need to build a common shared cognitive vision of whether and how sustainable urban transformation can take place.

654,WOS:000329306300003,"Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is the most widely recognised green building assessment system in the United States but is increasingly criticised for only rewarding incremental solutions towards sustainability. With differing perceptions of how green building is best achieved, here we focus on how geographical context and reuse of existing buildings are rewarded. The conceptual framework for our analysis draws upon a light green/deep green dichotomy in sustainability and architectural design. While a light green perspective achieves reduced energy consumption and pollution through technology and green gadgetry, a deep green approach focuses on local geographic conditions to work with natural climate systems through design informed by vernacular architecture, as well as the benefits of adaptive reuse. This study uses a descriptive case study analysis of LEED credit points earned in six certified buildings in Denver and Boulder, Colorado. Our analysis confirms that LEED rewards more light green approaches. There is limited motivation in pursuing sustainability through deep green methods, as recognition of them in LEED is quite minimal. We conclude that the balance against rewarding deep green design limits more transformative paradigm-shifting advances in sustainability. Recommendations for improvements to LEED are given, as well as a discussion on emerging local governance in regulating green building.

Central to the exercise of government in this manner, we argue, are climate change experiments'- purposive interventions in urban socio-technical systems designed to respond to the imperatives of mitigating and adapting to climate change in the city. Drawing on three different concepts - of governance experiments, socio-technical experiments, and strategic experiments - we first develop a framework for understanding the nature and dynamics of urban climate change experiments. We use this conceptual analysis to frame a scoping study of the global dimensions of urban climate change experimentation in a database of 627 urban climate change experiments in 100 global cities. The analysis charts when and where these experiments occur, the relationship between the social and technical aspects of experimentation and the governance of urban climate change experimentation, including the actors involved in their governing and the extent to which new political spaces for experimentation are emerging in the contemporary city. We find that experiments serve to create new forms of political space within the city, as public and private authority blur, and are primarily enacted through forms of technical intervention in infrastructure networks, drawing attention to the importance of such sites in urban climate politics. These findings point to an emerging research agenda on urban climate change experiments that needs to engage with the diversity of experimentation in different urban contexts, how they are conducted in practice and their impacts and implications for urban governance and urban life.","Bulkeley, H, Broto, VC",170,Davao,PHL,10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00535.x,SRID=4326;POINT (125.61278 7.07306),1212504,Government by experiment?

For this study, a basic single-pane window was selected as a baseline to compare to two basic double-pane windows and four energy-efficient windows in a single-family home. Seventeen United States cities were investigated to represent 17 climate regions. Using energy simulations, along with life cycle inventory and economic data for windows, a cradle-to-grave LCA and life cycle cost (LCC) analysis were conducted. Environmental and economic impacts are normalized and weighted to identify the best overall performing windows. Environmentally, the low-solar gain windows always performed best due to the reduction in electricity needs, whereas economically they performed best in warmer climates but high-solar gain windows performed best in cooler climates. Thirteen of the seventeen cities had window options with a payback period less than five years when all retrofitting option were compared. When projecting the impacts of retrofitting a large number of homes, it was found that metro Atlanta could reduce CO2 emissions by about a half a million metric tons of CO2 annually with any of the energy efficient window choices.

The ecocity model recognizes that cities are part of natural systems and favors walkable neighborhoods. This article introduces ecocity mapping, an innovative planning method, to the public health literature on community engagement by describing a pilot project with a new affordable housing development in Oakland, California between 2007 and 2009. Although ecocity mapping began as a paper technology, advances in geographic information systems (GIS) moved it forward. Objectives: This article describes how Ecocity Builders used GIS to conduct ecocity mapping to (1) assess vitality of neighborhoods and urban centers to prioritize community health intervention pilot sites and (2) create scenario maps for use in community health planning. Methods: From fall 2007 to summer 2008, Ecocity Builders assessed neighborhood vitality using walking distance from parks, schools, rapid transit stops, grocery stores, and retail outlets. In 2008, ecocity maps were shared with residents to create a neighborhood health and sustainability plan. In 2009, Ecocity Builders developed scenario maps to show how changes to the built environment would improve air quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, while increasing access to basic services and natural amenities. Conclusions: Community organizing with GIS was more useful than GIS alone for final site selection. GIS was useful in mapping scenarios after residents shared local neighborhood knowledge and ideas for change.

In recent years, the transformation of superblocks to a new urban form with human-scale blocks and fine-grain grid road networks in certain cities in China has drawn much attention. Despite its recent positive attention, the following important questions have been raised: How will the transformation impact road network capacity? How will the changes contribute to transportation carbon emission (CE) reduction or increase? How will cities deal with rearranging the cost structure among the different stakeholders in road construction, maintenance, and management? Related factors and approaches for a solution to such issues are discussed in this study, followed by further analysis using a case study of the core area of Chenggong, a new town in Kunming, China. The study shows that concern about a negative impact on road network capacity is unfounded. Estimation using empirical data from other cities shows that a significant CE reduction is likely to be achieved; and through reasonable cost restructuring and management, a win-win situation is possible for all road construction, maintenance, and management stakeholders.

To examine potential chamber-specific effects on growth and transpiration, plants were also studied outside chambers at ambient CO2 levels. Plants were grown individually in 38 litre pots containing a mixture of soil and leaf litter, either in the absence or presence of a slow-release fertilizer. Data from three experiments. lasting 7 to 9 weeks each, are presented. Transpirational water loss of plants was determined gravimetrically. Fertilized plants grew more rapidly than unfertilized plants. Elevated CO2 strongly enhanced biomass accumulation in fertilized plants. In unfertilized plants, elevated CO2 enhanced growth in two experiments, but not in a third. Transpiration ratios (TR, g water lost: g dry mass accumulated) of plants grown in open-top chambers ranged from 176 (elevated CO2 plus fertilizer) to 336 (ambient CO2, minus fertilizer). The addition of fertilizer decreased TR by 15 to 20%, irrespective of the CO2 concentration, and elevated CO2 reduced TR by 27 to 35%, irrespective of whether fertilizer was present or not. The reduction in TR in response to elevated CO2, was independent of whether biomass accumulation was enhanced by elevated CO2 or not. In all experiments in which biomass accumulation was increased at elevated CO2, absolute water expenditure at elevated CO2 was greater or similar to that at ambient levels - despite the lower TR at elevated CO2 In the single experiment in which elevated CO2 diet not lead to increased growth, the absolute water expenditure of plants was lower at elevated than at ambient CO2.

As a rodent-borne disease with a seasonal distribution, external environmental factors including climate factors may play a significant role in its transmission. The city of Shenyang is one of the most seriously endemic areas for HFRS. Here, we characterized the dynamic temporal trend of HFRS, and identified climate-related risk factors and their roles in HFRS transmission in Shenyang, China. Methods: The annual and monthly cumulative numbers of HFRS cases from 2004 to 2009 were calculated and plotted to show the annual and seasonal fluctuation in Shenyang. Cross-correlation and autocorrelation analyses were performed to detect the lagged effect of climate factors on HFRS transmission and the autocorrelation of monthly HFRS cases. Principal component analysis was constructed by using climate data from 2004 to 2009 to extract principal components of climate factors to reduce co-linearity. The extracted principal components and autocorrelation terms of monthly HFRS cases were added into a multiple regression model called principal components regression model (PCR) to quantify the relationship between climate factors, autocorrelation terms and transmission of HFRS. The PCR model was compared to a general multiple regression model conducted only with climate factors as independent variables. Results: A distinctly declining temporal trend of annual HFRS incidence was identified. HFRS cases were reported every month, and the two peak periods occurred in spring (March to May) and winter (November to January), during which, nearly 75% of the HFRS cases were reported. Three principal components were extracted with a cumulative contribution rate of 86.06%. Component 1 represented MinRH(0), MT(1), RH(1), and MWV(1); component 2 represented RH(2), MaxT(3), and MAP(3); and component 3 represented MaxT(2), MAP(2), and MWV(2). The PCR model was composed of three principal components and two autocorrelation terms. The association between HFRS epidemics and climate factors was better explained in the PCR model (F = 446.452, P < 0.001, adjusted R(2) = 0.75) than in the general multiple regression model (F = 223.670, P < 0.000, adjusted R(2) = 0.51). Conclusion: The temporal distribution of HFRS in Shenyang varied in different years with a distinctly declining trend.

Although part-night lighting schemes have been adopted by many local authorities across Europe to reduce the carbon footprint and save energy, their effects on biodiversity are unknown. Through a paired, insitu experiment, we compared the activity levels of 8bat species under unlit, part-night, and full-night lighting treatments in a rural area located 60km south of Paris, France. We selected 36 study locations composed of 1lit site and a paired unlit control site; 24 of these sites were located in areas subject to part-night lighting schemes, and 12 sites were in areas under standard, full-night lighting. There was significantly more activity on part-night lighting sites compared to full-night lighting sites for the late-emerging, light-sensitive Plecotus spp., and a similar pattern was observable for Myotis spp., although not significant. In contrast, part-night lighting did not influence the activity of early emerging bat species around streetlights, except for Pipistrellus pipistrellus for which there was significantly less activity on part-night lighting sites than on full-night lighting sites. Overall, no significant difference in activity between part- and full-night lighting sites were observed in 5 of the 8 species studied, suggesting that current part-night lighting schemes fail to encompass the range of activity of most bat species.

AD can reduce the volume of OFMSW going to landfill and produce, at the same time, biogas and compost, all at a profit. The uncertainty about the collected quantity of organic fraction, however, may undermine the economic-financial sustainability of such plants. While the flexibility characterizing some AD technologies may prove very valuable in uncertain contexts since it allows adapting plant capacity to changing environments, the investment required for building flexible systems is generally higher than the investment for dedicated equipment. Hence, an adequate justification of investments in these flexible systems is needed. This paper presents the results of a study aimed at investigating how different technologies may perform from technical, economic and financial standpoints, in presence of an uncertain organic fraction quantity to be treated.

However, little attention has been paid to the ways in which this emerging role can be framed. Therefore, this study aims to examine the combined impacts of socioeconomic and spatial planning factors on CO2 emissions in cities that have experienced rapid urbanization, using an econometric model and a comprehensive panel dataset incorporating socioeconomic, urban form, and transportation factors for four Chinese megacities Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou, in the period 1990-2010. Making use of remote sensing land-use data, the digitization of transportation maps, and a set of socioeconomic data, we developed an extended STRIPAT model in order to empirically estimate the impacts of the selected variables on CO2 emission levels in these cities. The results indicate that the socioeconomic factors of economic growth, urbanization, and industrialization will lead to increased CO2 emissions, while the service level and technology level can contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. The results also suggest that the expansion of urban land use and increases in urban population density should be controlled through urban planning measures in order to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, pursuing compact urban development patterns would also help to reduce CO2 emissions. Transportation factors including urban road density and the traffic coupling factor were both found to have exerted significant negative effects on CO2 emission levels, indicating that increases in the coupling degree between urban spatial structure and traffic organization can also contribute to reducing such emissions. Our results cast a new light on the importance of practices of urban planning and spatial optimization measures in achieving CO2 emission reductions.

If the maximum reuse/recycling rates are applied to the closed- and open-loop material flows in Jakarta, then it would become possible to not only decrease the final disposal waste (from 123.9 to 2.1 million ton) but also reduce the corresponding embodied energy (from 247.8 to 192.1 PJ) and CO2 emissions (from 24.3 to 19.2 million ton CO2-eq) compared with the zero reuse/recycling scenario from 2012 to 2020.",,0,Jakarta; Bandung,IDN; IDN,10.1007/s10163-015-0460-1,SRID=4326;POINT (106.84513 -6.21462); SRID=4326;POINT (107.60694 -6.92222),8540121; 1699719,"Evaluation of current material stock and future demolition waste for urban residential buildings in Jakarta and Bandung, Indonesia: embodied energy and CO2 emission analysis",2017
669,WOS:000322803300015,"The importance of the interactions between global environmental and socioeconomic changes in shaping vulnerability and exposure to hazards is now increasingly recognised. However, relatively little attention has been focused on the ways in which these interactions help to shape planning and policy in response to both processes. This paper examines how the intersections between the twin crises of economic recession and climate change are influencing hazards mitigation policy and climate change adaptation planning in three of Ireland's coastal cities. The cities of Dublin, Cork, and Galway are important case studies for this analysis due to the magnitude of socioeconomic and environmental changes they have witnessed in recent years. The paper begins by using the double-exposure framework to analyse how the interactions between global environmental and socioeconomic change have produced the contextual environment within which decision making and policy formation take place. This is followed by the presentation and analysis of the results of semistructured interviews with local decision makers and stakeholders. These illustrate that the interactions between environmental change and economic crisis have created the material and ideological conditions in which a neoliberal growth centred discourse of economic development dominates all areas of decision making and- policy. This has important implications for environmental policy and planning in cities, promoting a vision of a modern competitive city in which technological solutions are the preferred means of addressing flood risks. These decisions in turn reshape the exposures and vulnerabilities of local communities.","Jeffers, JM",9,Dublin; Cork,IRL; IRL,10.1068/a45386,SRID=4326;POINT (-6.24889 53.33306); SRID=4326;POINT (-8.470610000000001 51.89797),1024027; 190384,Double exposures and decision making: adaptation policy and planning in Ireland's coastal cities during a boom-bust cycle,2013

671,WOS:000329952500154,"Seventy-five heavy-duty public transit buses, including different fuel systems (conventional diesel, natural gas and diesel hybrid), were tested on-road in Beijing using portable emission measurement systems. Second-by-second driving condition data were collected on typical urban bus routes including freeways, arterial roads and residential roads. The average values of distance-specific fuel consumption for diesel buses is 32.6 L 100 km(-1) under a typical bus driving cycle in Beijing (BJBC). Natural gas buses have comparable CO2 emission factors but higher fuel consumption relative to diesel buses. Hybrid diesel buses are capable of reducing CO2 emissions and fuel consumption by 18-29% compared to the Euro IV and Euro V diesel buses over the BJBC. This study quantified the impacts on fuel consumption from other conditions including road type, average speed, load mass, and air conditioning. Average speed is the leading indicator of traffic conditions which affects the on-road fuel use most significantly. If the average bus speed decreases from 25 km h(-1) to 15 km h(-1), fuel consumption is estimated to increase by similar to 20-30% for diesel buses, similar to 30-45% for natural gas buses, and most significantly (similar to 50%) for hybrid diesel buses. In addition, real-world fuel consumption of hybrid diesel buses is observed to be particularly sensitive to operating conditions - when their on-board air conditioning systems are functioning, fuel consumption can be increased by up to 50%.

An extended WRAP tool methodology has been developed and is illustrated through assessing the relative carbon dioxide performance of different aggregate sourcing options for the large redevelopment project known as Masshouse, in the centre of Birmingham, UK. Previously unconsidered factors such as aggregate quality and highway congestion have been included. It is shown that significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved where site-derived demolition waste is reprocessed for use on site as a recycled aggregate and that relative haulage distances are of particular importance to overall carbon dioxide emissions. As these outcomes depend upon the distances to materials sources and sinks in Birmingham, it is concluded that the carbon dioxide emissions associated with aggregate sourcing are not just a function of material type but also of local conditions. Therefore, the developed methodology provides a useful decision-making framework for assessing aggregate sourcing that accounts for factors such as distribution of materials sources and sinks, aggregate grade, and the effects of road speed and congestion.","Mice, AT, Lombardi, DR, Hunt, D, Gaterell, M",1,Birmingham,GBR,10.1680/ensu.2009.162.3.135,SRID=4326;POINT (-1.89983 52.48142),984333,Estimating carbon dioxide emissions for aggregate use,2009

Carbon emission during the process of municipal sewage treatment and disposal has become one of the important sources of greenhouse gases that cause greenhouse effect. How to reduce carbon dioxide emissions during sewage treatment and disposal process is of great significance for reducing air pollution. Kitchen waste and excess sludge, as two important organic wastes, once uses anaerobic synergetic digestion technology in the treatment process can on the one hand, avoid instability of sludge individual anaerobic digestion, improve sludge degradation rate and marsh gas production rate, and on the other hand, help increase the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to a great extent. The paper uses material balance method, analyzes and calculates the carbon dioxide emissions from kitchen waste and sludge disposed by the anaerobic synergetic digestion technology, compares the anaerobic synergetic digestion technology with traditional sludge sanitary landfill technology and works out the carbon dioxide emission reductions after synergetic digestion. It takes the kitchen waste and sludge synergetic digestion engineering project of Zhenjiang city in Jiangsu province as an example, makes material balance analysis using concrete data and works out the carbon dioxide daily emission reductions. The paper analyzes the actual situation of emission reduction by comparing the data, and found that the synergetic digestion of ldtchen waste and sludge can effectively reduce the carbon dioxide emission, and the reduction is obvious especially compared with that of sludge sanitary landfill, which has a certain effect on whether to promote the use of the technology.

India's urbanization trajectory will have crucial implications on its future GHG emission levels. Using household microdata from India's 60 largest cities, this study maps GHG emissions patterns and its determinants. It also ranks the cities with respect to their household actual and ""counter-factual"" GHG emissions from direct energy use. We find that household GHG emissions from direct energy use correlate strongly with income and household size; population density, basic urban services (municipal water, electricity, and modern cooking-fuels access) and cultural, religious, and social factors explain more detailed emission patterns. We find that the ""greenest"" cities (on the basis of household GHG emissions) are Bareilly and Allahabad, while the ""dirtiest"" cities are Chennai and Delhi; however, when we control for socioeconomic variables, the ranking changes drastically. In the control case, we find that smaller lower-income cities emit more than expected, and larger high-income cities emit less than expected in terms of counter-factual emissions. Emissions from India's cities are similar in magnitude to China's cities but typically much lower than those of comparable U.S. cities. Our results indicate that reducing urban heat-island effects and the associated cooling degree days by greening, switching to modern nonsolid cooking fuels, and anticipatory transport infrastructure investments are key policies for the low-carbon and inclusive development of Indian cities.","Ahmad, S, Baiocchi, G, Creutzig, F",12,Chennai; Delhi; Bareilly,IND; IND; IND,10.1021/es505814g,SRID=4326;POINT (80.27847 13.08784); SRID=4326;POINT (77.23148999999999 28.65195); SRID=4326;POINT (79.43167 28.36678),4328063; 10927986; 745435,CO2 Emissions from Direct Energy Use of Urban Households in India,2015

Seeking to address shortcomings in existing studies of local environmental governance, we focus particular attention on how climate change became a political priority in Portland, how a particular representation of local carbon dioxide emissions was developed in the process of public consultations, and how the local state attempted to achieve its adopted policy objectives by enlisting the self-governing capacities of its residents. To carry out such an analysis, we draw on both actor-network theory (ANT) and governmentality. The first approach offers an understanding of how collective priorities emerge as different actants learn how to move toward their goals by working together, and also suggests how subjects and objects are reshaped by their enrolment in such configurations. The second approach offers a more precise understanding of how the state attempts to achieve its objectives-once they are established-by conducting the conduct of its citizens. Brought together, we argue, ANT an govern mentality provide an incisive approach to questions of local environmental governance, and to broader political concerns as well. As each approach addresses well-cited shortcomings of the other, the combined approach developed in this paper could be deployed in many studies that examine the emergence of political priorities and the capacity to achieve them.","Rutland, T, Aylett, A",119,Oregon; Portland,USA; USA,10.1068/d6907,SRID=4326;POINT (-89.38455999999999 42.92611); SRID=4326;POINT (-122.67621 45.52345),10043; 632309,"The work of policy: actor networks, governmentality, and local action on climate change in Portland, Oregon",2008

As a typical energy-saving method for buildings, reducing the internal heat sources and increasing the insulation are also assessed. We used a coupled urban canopy and building energy model to predict the heat loads of buildings in city districts, the effects of air-conditioning on energy consumption, and air temperature changes. In this model, a vertical one-dimensional local atmospheric model is coupled with an air-conditioning load calculation model for buildings, making it possible to assess the interaction between anthropogenic heat release due to air-conditioning usage and the outside thermal environment. In this study, we selected a target study region in the city of Kawasaki, Japan. When typical city districts were assessed, planting greenery or increasing albedo achieved temperature reductions of 0.6-1.0 degrees C and 0.1-0.5 degrees C, respectively, and energy savings of 40-80 and 70-90 kJ/m(2)/day (per unit floor area) on a typical summer day. The results from the large-scale assessment show that urban greening or albedo increases achieved the highest energy savings, of up to 400 t-CO2/day, in the entire target study region.

In this regard, different designs of hybrid solar/fossil fuel gas turbine cogeneration systems have been proposed. The proposed designs consider the possible integration of three main Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies, which are namely, Solar Tower (ST) systems, Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) system, and Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) systems with conventional gas turbine cogeneration systems. These three CSP technologies were assessed for possible integration with a gas turbine cogeneration system that generates steam at a constant flow rate of 81.44 kg/s at P = 45.88 (bar) and temperature of T = 394 degrees C throughout the year in addition to the generation of electricity. THERMOFLEX with PEACE simulation software has been used to assess the performance of the integrated solar gas turbine cogeneration with three different CSP technologies for different gas turbine sizes under Dhahran weather conditions. The three CSP technologies to be integrated individually to the gas turbine cogeneration plant are; parabolic trough collectors and linear Fresnel reflectors to the steam side and the solar tower to the gas side of the plant. Thermo-economic comparative analysis have been conducted for all possible configurations of the integrated solar gas turbine cogeneration plant to reach at the optimal levelized electricity cost (LEC). The optimization process also includes CO2 emissions for each integrated solar gas turbine cogeneration plant (ISGCP) configuration for each the three CSP technologies in comparison with the integration of CO2 capture technology to the conventional plant. The simulation results revealed that the optimal configuration is the integration of LFR with the steam side of a gas turbine cogeneration plant of 50 MWe, which gives a LEC of 5.1 USC/kW h with 119 k ton reduction of the annual CO2 emission.

682,WOS:000356990800041,"Urban areas play a key role in climate change mitigation. We investigate here energy systems design to increase the use of renewable electricity (RE) such as photovoltaics and wind power in cities. We analyzed the hourly temporal and spatiotemporal energy demand and supply patterns in Delhi, Shanghai and Helsinki to understand how energy systems respond to high RE shares, and to determine realizable levels of RE power. The results indicate that if limiting the RE output to the instantaneous power demand, a 20% yearly share of electricity could be reached. Increasing the RE beyond this limit without a smart design adds only limited benefit. Adding short-term electrical storage could increase the RE share of power in Shanghai to 50-70%, in Delhi to 40-60%, and in Helsinki to 25-35%. An electricity-to-thermal conversion strategy in which surplus RE power is utilized for heating, enables to increase the wind power use in Helsinki up to 64% of the yearly electricity demand, but in addition, to cover 30% of the yearly heat demand. Such a scheme would add ca 10% to the overall wind power investment. A high RE share affects the existing power mix and the plant capacity factors, which need to be re-optimized. In the above cases, RE replaces fossil fuel and coal power plants and therefore the CO2 emission reductions from smart design are proportional to the RE shares shown. Smart energy system design could help mainstreaming renewable electricity as part of the cities' carbon reduction strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Among them, the Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program (TCTP), implemented since 2010, is an important measure to accelerate the building sector's emission reduction to achieve Tokyo's greenhouse gas target, 25% reduction by 2020 from a year 2000 baseline level. Under TCTP, all large commercial and industrial facilities are required to achieve the 25% reduction in two compliance periods (FY2010-14 and FY2015-19).

This paper assesses the effectiveness of TCTP based on extensive data obtained from 1300 facilities covered by the programme and surveys among facility owners from the first compliance phase. Data indicate that TCTP has been working effectively to reduce energy consumption in participating facilities to meet the ambitious emission reduction goals, to introduce new technologies, and to raise awareness and drive behavioural changes for energy demand reduction.

DBT can explain 97.7% of the coal consumption at different time scales and 83.0-89.7% of the natural gas consumption. DBT can also account for 25% of the daily and monthly heating electricity consumption and 89% of the annual heating electricity consumption. These results suggest that different measures for building energy conservation should be taken because of the differing climate impacts for different energy types.

Reducing the vulnerability and increasing the resilience of these systems has thus becomes a focus of research, disaster planning, and policy-making. Seaports, located in environmentally sensitive, high-risk locations, are particularly vulnerable to severe storms and the increased sea levels resulting from such climate changes. Planning and policy making for seaports must therefore consider the human factor, that is the population potentially vulnerable to climate change induced events and also the complex network of stakeholders that depend on their functionality. An increasing body of literature suggests that, for planners to be effective in increasing resiliency of social-environmental systems to climate change-related events and other hazards, they must understand and incorporate the perceptions and concerns of the stakeholders in their assessment and planning processes. This study uses empirical evidence collected through case studies of two particularly exposed ports in the US: Gulfport (Mississippi) and Providence (Rhode Island), in order to examine how port stakeholders such as port operators, municipal planners, port tenants, and coastal managers, perceive storm impacts and the seaport's vulnerability, and how their planning and policy making address these perceived concerns. Results suggest the following: (1) Port stakeholders of Gulfport (MS) and Providence (RI) identified a wide range of direct damages, indirect costs, and intangible consequences of a hurricane hitting the port; (2) these impacts would result in costs that would be borne by all port stakeholders as well as society as a whole; and (3) in Providence and Gulfport, plans and policies that address storm resilience for the ports did not include the concerns of many stakeholders.

Successful implementation of 'solar city' options will depend on the strategic application of finance mechanisms, solar energy soft cost policies, and other policy tools, as well as the grid price of electricity. Capital markets recently have embraced the roll-out of new financial instruments, including 'green bonds,' which could be incorporated into solar city project design to attract large investments at a low cost. A multivariate analysis method is employed to consider solar city possibilities for six cities: Amsterdam, London, Munich, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo.

These action plans are linked to different municipal promotion tools, and a set of indicators has also been proposed to define and monitor the actions. In general, the adequacy of the main indicators used by the SEAPs is analysed, taking into consideration the representation of the urban system across all scales (city, neighbourhood and building) as well as whether the chosen indicators enable the analyst to consider the influence of human activities (i.e. hours of use) on energy consumption, within the system. In contrast, this paper proposes to apply the fund-flow model as an accounting framework that can be used to develop indicators for energy-efficient urban planning. The energy model behind these indicators was obtained using an innovative procedure for energy simulation which considers the isolated characteristics of the buildings (type of construction, occupation, interior comfort, type of energy system) as well as the interaction with the surrounding buildings (shadows, streets, geometry).The indicators proposed have been developed within the SEMANCO UE project, and we have taken into account their potential as criteria for identifying the most effective actions for energy planning on multilevel scales. An example in Manresa (Spain) is used to test the usability. Our results demonstrate that these indicators are suitable for use in decision-making processes in the field of urban planning and for performing coherent comparisons of actions between urban areas, cities, countries or regions.

688,WOS:000307037900020,"District heating can provide cost-effective and low-carbon energy to local populations. Although this is rare in the UK, Sheffield already has an award-winning district energy network. It has been previously determined that this could be expanded to incorporate new heat sources and sinks. This paper determines the environmental and socio-economic impacts, focussing on various fuels. Combined-heat-and-power generation in Sheffield coupled with sustainable/renewable fuels, like waste, offer high efficiencies (>77%) and consistently lower carbon emission factors (0.04-0.14 kg/MJ) than conventional energy generation using fossil fuels, since up to 80% of the fuel-carbon is biogenic (CO2-neutral). Processing municipal waste into a refuse-derived fuel prior to combustion or lowering the return-water temperature by 35 degrees C in the district heating network could further improve efficiencies (81-93%) and reduce CO2 emission rates by 4 t/h for the Sheffield plant, increasing avoided emissions from 69,000 t/a to 80,000-91,000 t/a. Moreover, ways in which the energy supply could be further decarbonised were identified, as well as methods to minimise the impacts of responding to changes in demand. Though initial costs of such schemes are high, they can be economically-viable for the investor/operator and consequently offer competitive rates for customers.

Drawing on discussions with residents in informal settlements and interviews with staff from government agencies, NGOs and donors, it shows the lack of connection between the formal institutional structure for disaster preparedness and the groups most at risk from extreme weather disasters and their community level actions. There is no clear definition of roles among local government agencies with regard to climate change adaptation. Although there is a donor-funded programme to reduce poverty and disaster risks, this is not being implemented in the settlements most at risk from landslides. Neither are there any measures underway to address the needs of the residents in these high risk settlements, in part because of the financial weakness of local government. Nor is there much support for this from national government - since national climate change adaptation policy does not consider urban adaptation and strengthening urban government capacity to reduce the vulnerability of the extreme poor as a priority.

A Decision Support System (DSS) can help to optimize effective use of the scarce human resources available. In this paper we present a DSS that merges predictive policing capabilities with a patrolling districting model, for the design of predictive patrolling areas. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with the Spanish National Police Corps (SNPC), defines partitions of the territory under the jurisdiction of a district that are efficient and balanced at the same time, according to the preferences of a decision maker. To analyze the crime records provided by the SNPC, a methodology for the description of spatially and temporally indeterminate crime events has been developed. The DSS has been tested with a case study in the Central District of Madrid. The results of the experiments show that the proposed DSS clearly outperforms the patrolling area definitions currently in use by the SNPC. To compare the solutions in terms of efficiency loss, we discuss how to build an operational envelope for the problem considered, which can be used to identify the range of performances associated with different patrolling strategies.

Current mortality data for Delhi are used as context to estimate the extent to which urban health outcomes are shaped by infrastructure and infrastructure-related environmental factors, some of which could directly or indirectly reduce mortality through low-carbon interventions. Mortality data along with a preliminary survey of expert opinion indicate up to 19 percent of all recorded deaths in Delhi may be infrastructure-related. More detailed epidemiology studies and infrastructure models are needed to confirm these initial findings.

Multiple data sets (MODIS, AERONET, OMI/TOMS, MISR, GOCART, ground-based aerosol measurements) are used to examine monthly trends in aerosol composition, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and aerosol size. Fine soil, sulfate, and organics dominate PM2.5 mass in the region. Dust strongly influences the region between March and July owing to the dry and hot meteorological conditions and back trajectory patterns. Because monsoon precipitation begins typically in July, dust levels decrease, while AOD, sulfate, and organic aerosol reach their maximum levels because of summertime photochemistry and monsoon moisture. Evidence points to biogenic volatile organic compounds being a significant source of secondary organic aerosol in this region. Biomass burning also is shown to be a major contributor to the carbonaceous aerosol budget in the region, leading to enhanced organic and elemental carbon levels aloft at a sky-island site north of Tucson (Mt. Lemmon). Phoenix exhibits different monthly trends for aerosol components in comparison with the other sites owing to the strong influence of fossil carbon and anthropogenic dust. Trend analyses between 1988 and 2009 indicate that the strongest statistically significant trends are reductions in sulfate, elemental carbon, and organic carbon, and increases in fine soil during the spring (March-May) at select sites.

By integrating emission source data with existing official statistics as well as using restating methodology of data mapping for 1 km grid, the authors constructed high resolution emission gridded data in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (jing-jin-Ji) region in China for 2012. Comparisons between urban and non urban areas of carbon emissions from industry, agriculture, household and transport exhibited regional disparities as well as sectoral differences. Except for the Hebei province, per capita total direct carbon emissions from urban extents in Beijing and Tianjin were both lower than provincial averages, indicating the climate benefit of urbanization, comparable to results from developed countries. Urban extents in the Hebei province were mainly industrial centers while those in Beijing and Tianjin were more service oriented. Further decomposition analysis revealed population to be a common major driver for increased carbon emissions but climate implications of urban design, economic productivity of land use, and carbon intensity of GDP were both cluster- and sector-specific.

Using an activity diary survey and GIS-based land use data in Beijing, this research investigates how urban form characteristics at neighborhood and city scales impact individual's daily travel behavior and subsequent CO2 emission from work and non-work trips, respectively. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is adopted to examine the relationship between urban form, travel behavior, and CO2 emission, while accounting for residential self-selection and socio-demographic attributes. Results show that residents living in neighborhoods with higher job density, proximity to an employment sub-center and greater subway accessibility tend to travel shorter distance, choose low-carbon travel modes, and emit less CO2 from work related trips. People resident in neighborhoods with higher retail density or mixed land use tend to travel shorter distance and have less CO2 emission from non-work trips. The research also suggests that work related trips have larger variation than non-work trips across neighborhoods, indicating the job-housing spatial mismatch might be the main factor that drives up travel demand and transport CO2 emission in urban Beijing.

699,WOS:000367561800006,"International negotiations struggle to keep pace with global problems like climate change. To fill this gap, local governments increasingly take matters into their own hands. For example, to promote the benefits of clean energy, a local government might give subsidies to renewable energy companies. Since 2001, California has given $2 billion in such subsidies, while states ranging from Minnesota to Kansas and Mississippi have doled out hundreds of millions of dollars each. Cities, such as Austin and Los Angeles, have also gotten into the act, contributing millions to renewable energy firms. To build support for these measures, the local government might condition the subsidy on the recipient's use of components manufactured in the locality. In 2013, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said these kinds of subsidies are unlawful because they discriminate against foreign products. This Article argues that the decision fails to account for the public goods generated by such programs, and suggests a new way for the WTO to review local subsidy programs that would balance the WTO's impulse to protect international trade with the valuable global public goods such programs promise. To make the case, I report on the results of an original fifty-state survey. I identify forty-four state renewable energy programs in twenty-three states within the United States that violate the WTO's 2013 decision. I argue that these programs can increase global welfare in the aggregate, notwithstanding their discriminatory nature. They can do so by creating political support at the local level for renewable energy programs that might not pass otherwise. Local governments internalize few of the benefits from providing global public goods, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions through costly investments in renewable energy technology. Local efforts to address global public goods problems thus have to be linked to a concentrated benefit within the enacting jurisdiction. Protectionist measures that discriminate against foreign products provide this link, mobilizing local economic interests to pass global public goods programs that create benefits in other jurisdictions. Reforming international trade law to allow these linkages is imperative if local governments are to continue to play a role in solving global problems.","Meyer, T, Meyer, T",1,Austin; Los Angeles,USA; USA,,SRID=4326;POINT (-97.74306 30.26715); SRID=4326;POINT (-118.24368 34.05223),931830; 3971883,HOW LOCAL DISCRIMINATION CAN PROMOTE GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS,2015

Challenges still remain for metropolitan agencies in identifying the components or metrics for measuring resilience. Particularly, uncertainties in climate change and diversification in local contexts compel urban planners to mainstream community participation, indigenous knowledge and local attributes into the resilience assessment. This article aims to propose a novel methodology for assessing resilience, which can encourage stakeholder participation and communicate planners in shaping metropolitan land use policies. Using the Taichung metropolis, Taiwan as the study area, this article created a resilience metric called the Climatic Hazard Resilience Indicators for Localities (CHRIL) that is appropriate for use in a policy context. Then, this metric combined a fuzzy multicriteria decision analysis with a participatory geographic information system approach to measure and map resilience to climatic hazards. Through the participation of experts, local officers and community members, a multivariate analysis was applied to explain why low resilience areas occur in specific locations. Moreover, we performed a cluster analysis to group the areas into several types of resilience and revealed the relationship between the resilience factors and overall local development patterns. Results show that conflicts and tradeoffs may exist between some resilience factors, especially socioeconomic vulnerability and adaptive capacity. The findings provide stakeholders and policy-makers with a better governance structure to design and synthesize appropriate patchworks of planning measures for different types of resilience areas to reduce climatic hazard risks.

Many local authorities have to face questions of whether they should develop policies on climate change, and if so, on what evidence should policies be designed and delivered. This paper describes how academic research on the economics of low carbon cities (the 'mini-Stern review') helped create such an evidence base for the Leeds City Region and its constituent local authorities. We describe how the response to the evidence and the pathways to impact were different in the individual local authorities and what this means for our understanding of evidence in local policy making. In terms of Weiss' (Social sciences and modern states: national experiences and theoretical crossroads. Advances in political science, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1991) classification, the study was mainly useful as an argument and idea rather than being used instrumentally. We find that the policy and political context in each authority determines to a large extent whether such an academic study is useable as evidence. The contents and timing of the study need to align with existing policy and/or political agendas: is climate change on the agenda at all, with what priority and how is it framed. We find confirmation of a relationship between the policy problem type and the role of evidence as argument, idea or data. The mini-Stern study itself was just one contribution to wide-ranging processes of informing, convincing, pressurising, etc., not just within the different councils but also within the wider communities. Other contextual factors include composition, agenda and activities of local civil society and the local business community. Finally, it depends on the expertise of policy officers in the councils what use is made of evidence. Making policy takes (much) time, translation and negotiation across levels and sectors.

The present paper analyses the various factors contributing to a low percentage of bicycling in the Bangalore city and elicits certain policy aspects to improve the attractiveness of bicycling. The study focuses mainly on the behavioral aspects of commuters pertaining to their childhood and current scenario, and uses a face-to-face questionnaire survey for data collection. These behavioral aspects indicated a commuter's perception about social expectation, convenience and bicycling infrastructure using a 5-point Likert scale measurement. Information is also collected about factors that might motivate bicycling, and about demographic variables like age, gender, income, etc. The study used a statistical z-test to identify the most influential attitudinal factors and to check whether the various factors are significantly different. The results gave a clear picture about the most dominant attitudinal factors that resulted in the stoppage of bicycling during a commuter's childhood, and that acted as a deterrent to their bicycle usage in a current scenario. The study determined a need for changing the attitude of people towards cycling by programs that would create a positive image for cycling.

The study finds that around 40% of the survey respondents chose real carbon offsetting over a gift certificate as compensation for their participation in the survey, around half of whom chose carbon offsetting contribution to the world. However, most of the current Japanese carbon offsetting providers utilise only the carbon offsetting contribution to the Japanese government. Thus, Japanese citizens have significant untapped potential for undertaking more carbon offsetting to meet targets other than national targets. However, the results also show that there is a general lack of understanding regarding the mechanism of carbon offsetting. Carbon offsetting providers in Japan and other countries that may have national self-imposed targets and allowing the usage of international carbon offsetting should therefore be considered, so as to provide individuals with the options of either contributing to their government to help it meet its national target or contributing to the world to help reduce GHG emissions beyond the national targets.

706,WOS:000340336300002,"Urban water services are challenged from many perspectives and different stakeholders demand performance improvements along economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. In response, urban water utilities systematically give more attention to criteria such as water safety, climate change adaptation and mitigation, environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), total cost efficiency, and on how to improve their operations within the water-energy-carbon nexus. The authors of this paper collaborated in the development of a 'Dynamic Metabolism Model' (DMM). The model is developed for generic use in the sustainability assessment of urban water services, and it has been initially tested for the city of Oslo, Norway. The purpose has been to adopt a holistic systemic perspective to the analysis of metabolism and environmental impacts of resource flows in urban water and wastewater systems, in order to offer a tool for the examination of future strategies and intervention options in such systems. This paper describes the model and its application to the city of Oslo for the analysis time period 2013-2040. The external factors impacting decision-making and interventions are introduced along with realistic scenarios developed for the testing, after consultation with officials at the Oslo Water and Wastewater Works (Norway). Possible interventions that the utility intends to set in motion are defined and numerically interpreted for incorporation into the model, and changes in the indicator values over the time period are determined. This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the DMM, as a decision-support tool for water-wastewater utilities. The scenarios considered and interventions identified do not include all possible scenarios and interventions that can be relevant for water-wastewater utilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we used ecological network analysis to develop a spatially explicit model of carbon metabolism in Beijing and examined changes over time. Our goal was to identify the key elements and relationships with an eight nodes network model, with land considered as the node. Data for Beijing from 1990,1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 were combined with empirical coefficients to construct the network, which allowed us to quantitatively analyze the structure and function of the network and determine the key ecological relationships between components of the system, from the aspect of the system and each component. The analysis revealed that exploitation and control relationships were the dominant types that promoted the growth of the economy. The land for transportation and industry, and cultivation were the primary bodies of these two types of relationship. However, mutualism relationships maintained the stability of the system, with contributions from natural nodes and technological nodes at a low metabolic density. Simultaneously, the inevitable competition relationships somehow increased the efficiency of resource use of natural components and the cultivated land. Using quantitative simulation of carbon metabolism, we identified the negative relationships affecting healthy development of an urban area, and we offer a theoretical basis for the effective spatial adjustment of carbon management activity.

To date very little research has examined the more insidious issue of chronic year-round overheating in temperate climatic zones. The present study begins by reviewing the potential implications of planning and legislative constraints underlying urban residential design. A case study example is then introduced to examine the potential manifestation of such issues in practice. Detailed field monitoring and survey data from a number of newly built flats in a multi-residential block in London, is presented. Typical of a new generation of urban dwellings the development incorporates a high thermal specification together with low carbon building services, such as communal heating systems and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. Through detailed zonal measurements of a broad range of environmental and building services parameters it has been possible to isolate the key factors underpinning poor overheating performance for these flats. The findings of this case study are part of a larger research project investigating the causes of overheating in high density urban dwellings across Greater London. The results suggest that the causes of chronic overheating in these modern low-energy flats are multiple, but typically share common factors stemming from poorly integrated architectural and. MEP design decisions.

Concurrently, Australian houses have steadily increased in size from 1984 to 2009. This paper estimates the capacity of building codes to reduce residential emissions and achieve progressive reduction targets in light of increasing house sizes. A Residential Emissions Calculator was developed to compare heating and cooling loads for 72 new Australian houses-based on star ratings, historic Australian house sizes by state, and international house sizes. The analysis illustrates that house size has significant impact on the capacity of residential building codes to reduce emissions, and informs three key results: (1) Victoria is forecast to dominate emissions from new houses in Australia, (2) The increase in house size from 2003 to 2009 in Victoria decreased the effectiveness of moving from 5 stars to 6 stars by 38%, (3) Progressive CO2-e reduction targets of 80% could be achieved by a variety of house size and star rating scenarios (with significant housing affordability impacts). The result posit building codes and house size as potent strategies to limit energy associated emissions and underlines the need to apply these strategies in tandem as part of integrated national emissions management policy.

A fixed vehicle mass is normally used in VSP calculations. However, the influence of passenger load was always been neglected. The major objective of this paper is to quantify the influence of passenger load on diesel bus emissions and fuel consumption based on the real-world on-road emission data measured by the Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) on urban diesel buses in Nanjing, China. Meanwhile, analyses are conducted to investigate whether passenger load affected the accuracy of emission and fuel consumption estimations based on VSP. The results show that the influence of passenger load on emission and fuel consumption rates were related to vehicle's speed and acceleration. As for the distance-based factors, the influence of passenger load Was not obvious when the buses were driving at a relative high speed. However the effects of passenger load were significant when the per-passenger factor was used. Per-passenger emission and fuel consumption factors decreased as the passenger load increased. It was also found that the influence of passenger load can be omitted in the emission and fuel consumption rate models at low and medium speed bins but has to be considered in the models for high speed and VSP bins. Otherwise it could lead to an error of up to 49%. The results from this research will improve the accuracy of urban bus emission and fuel consumption modeling and can be used to improve planning and management of city buses and thus achieve energy saving and emission reduction.

717,WOS:000250685200004,"Since the 1970s, Canada has formulated various strategy measures to accelerate the development of energy efficiency systems and renewable energy technologies and has made significant progress. ""From 1990 to 2003, Canada's energy efficiency improved by an estimated 13%, or 883.3 petajoules, saving Canadians almost $13.4billion in 2003 alone and reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 52.3 megatonnes"". In 2000, about 17% of Canadian primary energy supply came from renewable sources (with hydroelectric, combustible renewables and waste). Canada is a leader in devising and implementing energy options for sustainable development. However, the nation still has great scope for furthering energy efficiency and more use of renewable energy. Canada has a higher aggregate intensity-absolute energy use per capita or per unit of GDP-than most International Energy Agency (lEA) countries, ranking second and fourth, respectively. In 2000, Canada used only a small amount of renewable energy (without hydroelectric, combustible renewables and waste), accounting for 1.3% of its primary energy supply. Canada has made little use of wind power compared to other industrialized countries. By June 2004, Canada's installed capacity was 341 megawatts (MW), compared to 13,407 MW installed by late 2003 in Germany, the country with the largest installed capacity. Canada's current small-scale hydroelectric capacity is about 2000 MW. Canada also has a few grid-connected wood-waste-fired power plants operational or under construction, with a maximum capacity of 60 MW. By 1999, Canada was generating 85.3 MW of electricity from captured municipal landfill gas. It is also worth noting that solar power is now finding niche applications in Canada, despite the fact that its cost remains relatively high (although falling). Canada is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. It has committed to reducing its emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2008-2012. But Canada's emissions level was already 24% above 1990 levels by 2003. As nearly 90% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions in Canada result from the production and consumption of fossil fuels, meeting the Kyoto target will challenge all Canadian governments and the energy industry to develop new and more effective strategies for speeding the development of sustainable energy to limit GHG emissions. There is an urgent need for analyzing current strategies of sustainable energy in Canada and examining the issues of these strategies. In theory and practice, however, there has so far been no a clear, integrated and comprehensive strategy framework for sustainable energy in Canada. Nor a clear definition of sustainable energy strategy was formulated. In this paper, we attempted to define sustainable energy strategy as the energy strategy aiming at improving energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy. Based on the definition above, we formulated an analytical framework for developing the strategies of sustainable energy. In the analytical framework, (1) sustainable energy strategy embraces strategic objectives, measures and management; (2) sustainable energy strategy is divided into two major groups: energy efficiency strategy and renewable energy strategy; (3) strategy measures of energy efficiency are classified as ten types; and (4) strategy measures of renewable energy are classified as four types. We have employed the framework to analyze current strategic objectives, strategic measures and policy and management strategies concerning sustainable energy in Canada and examine the issues of these strategies.

In water distribution networks (WDNs) water resource management is concerned with increased efficiency, which is primarily related to the reduction of leakages, whereas energy management refers to optimal pump, valve, and source scheduling strategies considering the hydraulic system requirements. These management goals require planning of asset renewal and improvement works in the short time (operational) and medium time (tactical) horizons, considering the financial sustainability of relevant actions. The battle of background leakage assessment for water networks (BBLAWN) was designed as a competition held at the 16th Water Distribution Systems Analysis Conference, in Bari (Italy) in 2014 (WDSA), to address the aforementioned management goals. The teams taking part in the BBLAWN were asked to develop a methodology for both reducing real water losses and saving energy in a real WDN considering the possibility of asset renewal and strengthening.

Due to its tropical location, dense urban morphology and higher than average density of population, buildings in Dhaka are likely to be adversely affected by the projected changes in climate, in particular by the increases in temperature. Buildings play a vital role in most aspects of our lives and their energy consumption patterns affect climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. It is important to understand the likely impact of the projected increases in temperature on cooling and heating requirements in buildings in future climates. In this research, global projections on changes in temperature are temporally downscaled using a statistically averaged baseline present-day hourly weather data to generate future weather data in three timeslices: 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Time series data for the present-day and future climates are analyzed as well as heating and cooling degree-days are calculated. Analysis shows that heating degree-days decrease whereas cooling degree-days continue to increase in future climates. The magnitude of change in monthly cooling degree-days is uneven and is greater in winter months than in summer and monsoon. Increased occurrences of temperatures above comfort threshold throughout the year are likely to have significant consequences for human health and wellbeing. The severity and duration of outdoor temperatures in the form of increased cooling degree-days in future climates will result in a surge in demand for energy for comfort cooling, which will add further stress to the already stressed energy infrastructure in the country.

Operating the CCHP system to follow the hourly thermal demand reduces CO2 emissions for most building types both with and without net metering. The system can be economically beneficial for all building types depending on the price of natural gas, the implementation of net metering, and the cost structure assumed for the CCHP system. The greatest reduction in water consumption for energy production and NOx emissions occurs when there is net metering and when the system is operated to meet the maximum yearly thermal demand, although this scenario also results in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and, in some cases, cost. CCHP systems are more economical for medium office, large office, and multifamily residential buildings. (C) 2016 THE AUTHORS.

723,WOS:000339133200022,"The potential of phase change materials (PCM) in reducing the heating/cooling energy consumption of residential houses along with several factors influencing the effectiveness of PCM were investigated using EnergyPlus. Simulations were carried out using five different phase change temperature ranges at eight Australian cities which represent six climate zones. It was found that the effectiveness of PCM strongly depends on local weather, thermostat range, PCM layer thickness and surface area. The optimum PCM melting range for lowest energy consumption in each month of the year was found to be far from unique. Different PCM was found to be effective in different times of the year. Depending on local weather, the integration of PCM resulted in 17-23% annual energy savings in the studied house except hot and humid cities like Darwin. For a given amount of PCM, energy saving potential was found to improve further with the increase of applied surface area and decrease of PCM layer thickness up to certain limit beyond which the potential started to decline. The energy saving potential was also found to decrease when the PCM melting point was outside the thermostat range of the corresponding city. The paper also presented the potential effect of climate change on the effectiveness of PCM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

724,WOS:000209451800004,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to suggest an approach to post-Kyoto climate negotiations that could provide a way out of the apparent deadlock between developed and developing countries. This is an urgent issue as the world already appears to be close to a level of climate change that could be considered ""dangerous"". Design/methodology/approach - The paper explores the potential that control of short-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, tropospheric ozone, and soot could have, in addition to steep cutbacks in industrialized nations, to both mitigate global warming and overcome political stalemate in the international climate negotiations. Findings - Although rarely mentioned in climate discourse, reducing emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases offers a cost-effective way of actually reducing the radiative forcing in the atmosphere, while at the same time producing substantial subsidiary benefits such as improved urban air quality. The paper suggests leveraging this potential in the post-Kyoto treaty in order to ""buy time"" to address the arguably more difficult problem of essentially eliminating fossil-fuel related CO2 emissions, which will ultimately be required to truly bring climate change under control. While high-income countries work on steep cutbacks of all greenhouse gas emissions, middle-income nations could make significant additional contributions by undertaking commitments to control only short-lived greenhouse gases until they reached a threshold level of per-capita GDP, at which point they would cap and begin reducing all greenhouse gas emissions. Originality/value - This paper recognizes that political tradeoffs will have to be made in negotiating the next climate treaty, and offers a way of approaching these tradeoffs that could minimize resulting environmental damage.","Moore, FC, MacCracken, MC",10,Kyoto,JPN,10.1108/17568690910934390,SRID=4326;POINT (135.75385 35.02107),1459640,Lifetime-leveraging An approach to achieving international agreement and effective climate protection using mitigation of short-lived greenhouse gases,2009

726,WOS:000392678000003,"Long-term pollutant concentration trends can be useful for evaluating air quality effects of emission controls and historical transitions in energy sources. We employed archival records of coefficient of haze (COH), a now-retired measure of light-absorbing particulate matter, to re-construct historical black carbon (BC) concentrations at urban locations in the United States (U.S.). The following relationship between COH and BC was determined by reinstating into service COH monitors beside aethalometers for two years in Vallejo and one year in San Jose, California: BC (mu g m(-3)) = 6.7COH + 0.1, R-2 = 0.9. Estimated BC concentrations in ten states stretching from the East to West Coast decreased markedly between 1965 and 1980: 5-fold in Illinois, Ohio, and Virginia, 4-fold in Missouri, and 2.5-fold in Pennsylvania. Over the period from the mid-1960s to the early 2000s, annual average BC concentrations in New Jersey and California decreased from 13 to 2 mu m(-3) and 4 to 1 mu g m(-3), respectively, despite concurrent increases in fossil fuel consumption from 1.6 to 2.1 EJ (EJ = 10(18) J) in New Jersey and 4.2 to 6.4 EJ in California. New Jersey's greater reliance on BC-producing heavy fuel oils and coal in the 1960s and early 1970s and subsequent transition to cleaner fuels explains why the decrease was larger in New Jersey than California. Patterns in seasonal and weekly BC concentrations and energy consumption trends together indicate that reducing wintertime emissions - namely substituting natural gas and electricity for heavy fuel oil in the residential sector - and decreasing emissions from diesel vehicles contributed to lower ambient BC concentrations. Over the period of study, declining concentrations of BC, a potent and shortlived climate warming pollutant, contrast increasing fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the U.S. Declining BC emissions may have had the benefit of mitigating some atmospheric warming driven by increased CO2 emissions with complementary health benefits.

More than 30% of the total energy is used to operate the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) subsystems. If it were possible to reduce energy consumption of HVAC subsystems a few percent, a significant quantity of electricity would be saved. From 2012 to 2013, we conducted field studies and developed autonomous control system for saving energy of HVAC systems in Beijing subway stations. The energy consumption features and the load signatures of the HVAC systems were investigated and we deployed comprehensive environment monitoring, passenger flow monitoring and run-time data logging subsystems to monitor and investigate the above features in several metro stations. The extracted features showed a broad space for optimizing current HVAC systems' operation to save energy. Based on the insights learned from the field studies, we spent four months to develop and deploy autonomous HVAC control systems in three metro stations. Up to now, the developed autonomous control systems have worked well and the energy logs showed that the autonomous control system helped the metro stations reduce energy in a range from 20% to 38% than the conventional control strategy.

Therefore, we propose the application of gas-fired boilers in underperforming heating substations as peak-load heat sources to effectively adapt to the regulation demands of seasonal heat-load fluctuations and reduce the excessive heat supply. First, we calculated the excessive heat supply rates (EHSRs) of five substations using detailed investigative data. We then discussed the feasibility of the proposed scheme providing energy savings from both energetic and exergetic points of view. The results showed that the average EHSR of the five substations between January and March was 20.57% of the gross heat production but consequently reduced to 6.24% with the installation of the gas-fired boilers. Therefore, the combined heating scheme with coal as the basic heat-source and gas-fired boilers as peak-load heat sources is energy-efficient to some extent, although requires the use of natural gas. Meanwhile, the exergy decreased by 10.97%, which indicates that the combined heating scheme effectively reduces the primary energy consumption and pollutant emission of the heating systems.

The paper discusses ambivalent pathways and 'regime resistance' caused by local economic and political specificities. The analysis illustrates how crucial the continual support from both policy makers and industry actors can be when economic market mechanisms do not drive sustainability transitions.

733,WOS:000275532900007,"Using a theoretical model and mass isotopic balance, biogas (methane and CO2) released from buried products at their microbial degradation was analysed in the landfill of municipal and non-toxic industrial solid organic waste near Kaluga city, Russia. The landfill contains about 1.34x106tons of waste buried using a 'sandwich technique' (successive application of sand-clay and waste layers). The 13C values of biogenic methane with respect to CO2 were-56.8 (+/- 2.5) parts per thousand, whereas the 13C of CO2 peaked at+9.12 parts per thousand (+1.4 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand on average), reflecting a virtual fractionation of carbon isotopes in the course of bacterial CO2 reduction at the landfill body. After passing through the aerated soil layers, methane was partially oxidised and characterised by 13C in the range of-50.6 to-38.2 parts per thousand, evidencing enrichment in 13C, while the released carbon dioxide had 13C of-23.3 to-4.04 parts per thousand, respectively. On the mass isotopic balance for the 13C values, the methane production in the landfill anaerobic zone and the methane emitted through the aerated landfill surface to the atmosphere, the portion of methane oxidised by methanotrophic bacteria was calculated to be from 10 to 40% (averaged about 25%).

It evaluates the effectiveness of local-scale energy policies in three sectors: households, transport, and the public sector (PS). Since the local energy demand is affected by summer tourism, seasonal consumption by holiday homes was also studied. Three scenarios were hypothesized: Business as Usual (BAU), Exemplary Public Sector (EPS), and Exemplary Municipality (EM). The EPS scenario models the exemplary role that recent European directives attribute to the PS in setting energy efficiency and technology penetration targets for itself; the EM scenario extends these targets to the household sector. In particular, the study underscores the potential of micro-cogeneration technologies in achieving local environmental targets, even though their diffusion would involve an increase in local energy consumption due to internalization of the primary energy used to produce electricity, which would no longer be wholly imported from outside municipal boundaries.

However, one of the main obstacles faced with upgrading existing urban systems to meet target energy reductions is the current rate of refurbishment and new build, where it is estimated that 75% of existing buildings will still be in place by 2050. Moreover limited renewable resources and predicted warming trends place further limitations on policies aimed at carbon management. This paper examines current thinking around energy management associated with building operational and regulated loads and the role of urban form.

736,WOS:000378354100008,"About 70aEuro-% of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted from the megacities and urban areas of the world. In order to draw effective emission mitigation policies for combating future climate change as well as independently validating the emission inventories for constraining their large range of uncertainties, especially over major metropolitan areas of developing countries, there is an urgent need for greenhouse gas measurements over representative urban regions. India is a fast developing country, where fossil fuel emissions have increased dramatically in the last three decades and are predicted to continue to grow further by at least 6aEuro-% per year through to 2025. The CO2 measurements over urban regions in India are lacking. To overcome this limitation, simultaneous measurements of CO2 and carbon monoxide (CO) have been made at Ahmedabad, a major urban site in western India, using a state-of-the-art laser-based cavity ring down spectroscopy technique from November 2013 to May 2015. These measurements enable us to understand the diurnal and seasonal variations in atmospheric CO2 with respect to its sources (both anthropogenic and biospheric) and biospheric sinks. The observed annual average concentrations of CO2 and CO are 413.0aEuro-+/- aEuro-13.7 and 0.50aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.37aEuro-ppm respectively. Both CO2 and CO show strong seasonality with lower concentrations (400.3aEuro-+/- aEuro-6.8 and 0.19aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.13aEuro-ppm) during the south-west monsoon and higher concentrations (419.6aEuro-+/- aEuro-22.8 and 0.72aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.68aEuro-ppm) during the autumn (SON) season. Strong diurnal variations are also observed for both the species. The common factors for the diurnal cycles of CO2 and CO are vertical mixing and rush hour traffic, while the influence of biospheric fluxes is also seen in the CO2 diurnal cycle. Using CO and CO2 covariation, we differentiate the anthropogenic and biospheric components of CO2 and found significant contributions of biospheric respiration and anthropogenic emissions in the late night (00:00-05:00aEuro-h, IST) and evening rush hours (18:00-22:00aEuro-h) respectively. We compute total yearly emissions of CO to be 69.2aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.07aEuro-Gg for the study region using the observed COaEuro-:aEuro-CO2 correlation slope and bottom-up CO2 emission inventory. This calculated emission of CO is 52aEuro-% larger than the estimated emission of CO by the emissions database for global atmospheric research (EDGAR) inventory. The observations of CO2 have been compared with an atmospheric chemistry-transport model (ACTM), which incorporates various components of CO2 fluxes. ACTM is able to capture the basic variabilities, but both diurnal and seasonal amplitudes are largely underestimated compared to the observations. We attribute this underestimation by the model to uncertainties in terrestrial biosphere fluxes and coarse model resolution. The fossil fuel signal from the model shows fairly good correlation with observed CO2 variations, which supports the overall dominance of fossil fuel emissions over the biospheric fluxes in this urban region.</p >.","Chandra, N, Lal, S, Venkataramani, S, Patra, PK, Sheel, V",4,Ahmedabad,IND,10.5194/acp-16-6153-2016,SRID=4326;POINT (72.58727 23.02579),3719710,Temporal variations of atmospheric CO2 and CO at Ahmedabad in western India,2016

This complementary approach to territorially-focused emission accounting has added critical nuance to the debate on climate change mitigation by highlighting the responsibility of consumers in a globalized economy. Yet, city officials are largely either unaware of their upstream emissions or doubtful about their ability to count and control them. This study provides the first internationally comparable GHG footprints for four cities (Berlin, Delhi NCT, Mexico City, and New York metropolitan area) applying a consistent method that can be extended to other global cities using available data.

Vehicle emissions and other anthropogenic related activities are a frequent source Of CO2 to the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Micrometeorological techniques used for observations in Northern Hemisphere cities have found that urban CO2 fluxes are consistently a source. This study investigates CO2 fluxes in an Australian city, adding to the global database of CO2 fluxes in a bid to aid in future development of planning policies concerning reductions in CO2 emissions. Using the eddy covariance approach, fluxes Of CO2 were measured at a suburban site (Preston) in Melbourne, Australia from February 2004 to June 2005 to investigate temporal variability. A second site (Surrey Hills) with differing surface characteristics (in particular, greater vegetation cover) was also established in Melbourne and ran simultaneously for 6 months (February 2004-July 2004). Results showed that both sites were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Diurnal patterns of fluxes were largely influenced by traffic volumes, with two distinct peaks occurring at the morning and evening traffic peak hours, with the winter morning peak averaging 10.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at Preston. Summer time fluxes were lower than during winter due to greater vegetative influence and reduced natural gas combustion. Vegetation limited the source of CO2 in the afternoon, yet was not enough to combat the strong local anthropogenic emissions.

The right vertical surface of the room is considered partially adiabatic and with a DGW. The DGW consists of two vertical semitransparent walls: glazing-1 facing the room, and glazing-2 facing the external environment; there is a SCF attached to glazing-1 for cold climate condition, or glazing-2 for warm climate condition. During one day, the hourly simulations of the R-DGW were done in an in-house code based on the finite volume method. To carry out the thermal analysis of the R-DGW, three cases were defined: Case Cl corresponds to the R-DGW without SCF; Case C2 and C3 correspond to the R-DGW with SCF for warm and cold climate condition, respectively. For warm climate condition the use of a SCF is highly recommended, since Case 2 reduces the amount of energy gained in approximate to 67.7% compared to Case 1.

741,WOS:000353095100013,"Food waste is a problem with economic, environmental and social implications, making it both important and complex. Previous studies have addressed food waste management options at the less prioritised end of the waste hierarchy, but information on more prioritised levels is also needed when selecting the best available waste management options. Investigating the global warming potential of different waste management options offers a limited perspective, but is still important for validating generations from the waste hierarchy in a local context. This study compared the effect on greenhouse gas emissions of different food waste management scenarios representing different levels in the waste hierarchy in the city of Uppsala, Sweden. A life cycle assessment was performed for six waste management scenarios (landfill, incineration, composting, anaerobic digestion, animal feed and donations), using five food products (bananas, grilled chicken, lettuce, beef and bread) as examples when treated as individual waste streams. For all five waste streams, the established waste hierarchy was a useful, but approximate, tool for prioritising the various options, since landfill proved to tie the worst option and donation, anaerobic digestion and incineration with energy recovery the best options, for easily handle products, wet products and dry products, respectively, taking into account the GHG emissions. The greatest potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions was in the bread waste stream, since bread is an energy-rich product with a relatively low carbon footprint, increasing the possibilities for replacing fossil energy carriers. Lettuce, with its high water content, had the least potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when the waste management method was changed. Waste valorisation measures should therefore focus on food products with the potential to replace production of goods and services, rather than on food products that are wasted in large quantities or have a high carbon footprint.

The roofs of the cells are removable so that one can analyze different roofs with a different coating each. We monitored the test cells for two weeks and measured roofs surface temperature, indoor air temperature and determined the heat flux of the roofs. The red roof (RR) had a surface temperature 3 C higher than the gray roof (GR) and this difference caused the RR to have a peak heat flux 20% higher. On the other hand, the white reflective roofs (WR) reduced the surface temperature between 10 and 14.6 degrees C compared with the GR. We obtained the daily heat gain of the roofs by calculating the area under the curve of the heat flux of each day. The WR had a daily heat gain between 59 and 80% lower than the GR, whereas the RR had a net heat gain 22% greater. Finally, using data from the experiments we validated roof model to determine the year-round performance of the roofs. From the results provided by the roof model, we estimated cost effectiveness of the roofs coatings. We found that WR are a cost-effective strategy to reduce building energy consumption in Mexico because its payback period is lower than 2 years. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The adverse health impacts of urban air pollution are well established, but less is known about effective intervention strategies. In this demonstration study we set out to establish methods to assess whether wearing an R95 activated carbon respirator could reduce intake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in street workers in Hanoi, Vietnam. Methods: In this demonstration study we performed a cross-over study in which non-smoking participants that worked at least 4 hours per day on the street in Hanoi were randomly allocated to specific respirator wearing sequences for a duration of 2 weeks. Urines were collected after each period, i.e. twice per week, at the end of the working day to measure hydroxy PAHs (OH-PAH) using gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was the urinary concentration of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP). Results: Forty-four participants (54.5% male, median age 40 years) were enrolled with the majority being motorbike taxi drivers (38.6%) or street vendors (34.1%). The baseline creatinine corrected urinary level for 1-OHP was much higher than other international comparisons: 1020 ng/g creatinine (IQR: 604-1551). Wearing a R95 mask had no significant effect on 1-OHP levels: estimated multiplicative effect 1.0 (95% CI: 0.92-1.09) or other OH-PAHs, except 1-hydroxynaphthalene (1-OHN): 0.86 (95% CI: 0.11-0.96). Conclusions: High levels of urine OH-PAHs were found in Hanoi street workers. No effect was seen on urine OH-PAH levels by wearing R95 particulate respirators in an area of high urban air pollution, except for 1-OHN. A lack of effect may be de to gaseous phase PAHs that were not filtered efficiently by the respirator.

Taking 1995-2000, 2000-2005, and 2005-2009 as the study periods, we decomposed the effects of changes in carbon emissions resulting from eight causal factors using the logarithmic mean divisia index method: economic activity and population size, which reflect the change in socioeconomic activity; energy intensity and energy consumption per capita, which reflect the change in the intensity of energy use; and economic structure, the urban and rural population distribution structure, and the energy mix of the production and household sectors, which reflect structural changes. We found that in all three study periods, the changes in economic activity, population size, and energy consumption per capita stimulated emissions, whereas the changes in energy intensity, the urban and rural population distribution structure, and the energy mix of the production and household sectors decreased emissions. In contrast, changes in the economic structure decreased emissions in the first and third periods, and increased emissions in the second period. Our results clearly indicate that under current practices, carbon emissions will increase as a result of rapid growth of the economy, the population, and the energy consumption per capita. In the future, the main routes to reduce carbon emissions will be to adjust the economic structure and energy mix, and to reduce the energy intensity of each sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In large buildings in Beijing and Shanghai the consumption rate, at approximately 190 kWh/m(2) per annum, is around five times the energy use in residential buildings in those cities. Addressing this ever increasing energy consumption and the consequential green house gas (GHG) emissions must be a priority to achieve low carbon sustainability in China. As part of the Kyoto Protocol the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has been used to assist in the finance of GHG reduction projects in developing countries in the context of low carbon sustainable development. However, hitherto the majority of CDM projects of an energy related nature have focussed almost exclusively on renewable energy projects or those which enhance the efficiency of industrial processes. To date the opportunities for using the CDM approach in reducing emissions in large buildings have been largely overlooked in China and other countries. Part of the reason is the lack of an adequate established baseline methodology against which the impact of any proposed CDM project can be judged.

746,WOS:000166055700013,"Contaminated and possibly hazardous ground represents a problem in all of the industrialized countries of the world. The investigation of a site that is suspected of being contaminated differs somewhat from a routine site investigation. Sampling of soils, groundwater and gas-producing material may be required. Various precautions may be necessary in doing this and operatives may have to wear protective clothing. Four case histories have been chosen to illustrate different aspects of the rehabilitation of abandoned contaminated land, namely, investigation, assessment, ground treatment and redevelopment. The Gst comes from Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, and outlines how a site investigation was undertaken and the nature of the contamination present, together with a note on the suggested redevelopment. The remaining three case histories are taken from the heavily industrialized district of the Ruhr in Germany, where extensive mining of coal and associated industries were developed from the mid-19th century onwards. The first considers the site of the former Graf Moltke mine near Essen. In this instance, the somewhat novel methods of data assessment and ground treatment are dealt with. The Mont Cenis site at Herne-Sodingen is one of the more notable old mining/industrial sites undergoing redevelopment in the state of North Rhine Westphalia. Hence, the case history concentrates of this aspect of rehabilitation. This involves not only the construction of new and interesting structures but an attempt to reduce energy consumption in an attempt to effect the concept of sustainable development of an urban area. The last example deals with the abandoned site of the Minister Achenbach mine at Lunen, where the ground conditions were further complicated by the presence of old bomb craters that had been filled with a variety of materials. In addition, because of the suspected presence of former foundation structures in the ground an electromagnetic survey was carried out across part of the site, the areas of high conductivity suggesting their presence.","Bell, FG, Genske, DD, Bell, AW",5,Leeds; Essen,GBR; DEU,10.1007/s002540000158,SRID=4326;POINT (-1.54785 53.79648); SRID=4326;POINT (7.01228 51.45657),455123; 593085,Rehabilitation of industrial areas: case histories from England and Germany,2000

In Vientiane, due to the lack of a collection service, open burning and illegal dumping are commonly practised. This study aims to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from the current situation of MSW management (MSWM) in Vientiane and proposes an alternative solution to reduce the GHG emission and environmental impacts. The 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006 model) are used for the estimation of GHG emission from landfill and composting. For the estimation of GHG emission from open burning, the Atmospheric Brown Clouds Emission Inventory Manual (ABC EIM) is used. In Vientiane, a total of 232505tonnesyear(-1) of MSW was generated in 2011. Waste generation in Vientiane is 0.69kg per capita per day, and about 31% of the total MSW generated was directly sent to landfill (71162tonnesyear(-1)). The total potential GHG emission from the baseline scenario in 2011 was 110182tonnesyear(-1) CO2-eq, which is 0.15 tonneyear(-1) CO2-eq per capita. From the three MSWM scenarios proposed, scenario S3, which includes recycling, composting and landfilling, seems to be an effective solution for dealing with MSW in Vientiane with less air pollution, and is environmentally friendly.

We examine these tensions through the development of the hydrogen energy economy in London and through attempts to cultivate new techniques of governance in realizing this vision. Through case study material, we develop two representations of the negotiation of new forms of governance. First, we outline the representation of 'London as world leader in progressive urban governance'. Second, we develop a characterization of 'the politics of the world city in CO2 reduction'. The article moves on to address the scalar making up of these representations, in relation to and through analysing multiple interpretations of London as a 'national exemplar'. The active positioning and representation of London as the exemplar by the national state and the specificities of London governance, we claim, enables the mayor to actively negotiate between the two sets of apparently conflicting logics of hydrogen development. London's energy strategy is therefore to a large extent 'nationalized' while at the same time national energy policy is also regionalized around London. Consequently, London is differentially and positively positioned in comparison to other city-regions of the UK. The need to develop a sustainability fix that can allow London, and the greater South East of England, to continue to grow economically and within the apparent constraints of environmental limits requires a specific governance fix around the national exemplar and new socio-technical energy networks, which we characterize as 'strategic glurbanization'.","Hodson, M, Marvin, S",30,London,GBR,10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00733.x,SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853),7556900,Understanding the role of the national exemplar in constructing 'strategic glurbanization',2007

The reconstruction is based on data triangulation that consists of semi-structured interviews with actors involved in these programs, policy documents and newspaper articles. Findings - The research illustrates the importance of stimuli such as strategically framing climate adaptation within wider urban agendas, political leadership and institutional entrepreneurs. Moreover, the research reveals that it is often a combination of stimuli that triggers a governance approach and that there is a possible link between specific stimuli and governance approaches, proposing that some stimuli will trigger a dedicated approach to climate adaptation, while others initiate a mainstreaming approach.

There is however lack of analysis of political and social processes which govern its actual take up. This paper examines these processes through a case study of Aberdeen, Scotland. Interviews and documentary analysis are used to examine the 2002 development of Aberdeen Heat and Power (AHP), an independent energy services company (ESCo). Technical-economic feasibility was a necessary component of appraisal, but not sufficient to govern decision-making. In the UK centralised energy market, DH investment is unattractive to commercial investors, and local authorities lack capacity and expertise in energy provision. In Aberdeen, the politics of fuel poverty converged with climate politics, creating an a-typical willingness to innovate through improvisation. The welfare priority resulted in creation of a non-profit locally-owned ESCo, using cost- rather than market-based heat tariffs. AHP has developed three combined heat and power energy centres and heat networks, supplying 34 MWh/pa of heat. Carbon savings are estimated to be 45% in comparison with electric heating, and heating costs are reduced by a similar amount. The conclusion outlines potential policy improvements.

759,WOS:000325237700010,"Buses and taxies are the most widely used vehicles for urban public transportation in developing countries. They contribute significantly to the emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants. Policy makers consider the introduction of new emissions standard vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles in bus and taxi fleets as an attractive measure for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants. It is important to understand the environmental benefits and economic challenges involved in fleet conversion. However, few studies have been conducted, especially in developing countries. This study analyzes the cost effectiveness and environmental benefits of various vehicles by employing a case study in Shenyang, China. The results showed that CNG bus has the best overall economic and environmental performances, while diesel car is one possible choice for taxi selection when considering the current technology level. Although direct emissions are lower for both hybrid and electricity vehicles, embodied emissions are higher, plus higher costs, making them not suitable as public transportation tools, at least for the current stage. In order to further improve co-benefits in public transportation sector, an integrated effort is needed, including the gradual phase-out of inefficient vehicles, green vehicle purchase, infrastructure improvement and capacity-building initiatives.

For low forcing, the estimated increase in cooling energy use was 18.5% in Harbin, 20.4% in Beijing, 11.4% in Shanghai, 24.2% in Kunming and 14.1% in Hong Kong; and the reduction in heating 22.3% in Harbin, 26.6% in Beijing, 55.7% in Shanghai, 13.8% in Kunming and 23.6% in Hong Kong. Space heating is usually provided by oil- or gas-fired boiler plants, whereas space cooling mainly relies on electricity. There would certainly be a shift towards electrical power demand. More energy use in buildings would lead to larger emissions, which in turn would exacerbate climate change and global warming. Energy conservation measures were considered to mitigate the impact of climate change on building energy use. These included building envelope, indoor condition, lighting load density and chiller coefficient of performance.

However, it has been unclear how structural and functional changes in urban carbon flows evolve with socioeconomic development in a long run, which is important for a more systemic and efficient carbon mitigation policy. The present study probes into the interaction between urban carbon metabolism and socioeconomic activities from a systems perspective. Taking Beijing as a case study, we model the dynamics between the changing carbon metabolism and variation in socioeconomic conditions over 1985-2030, based on a collection of system-based indicators from ecological network analysis. We find an ""inverted V curve"" carbon transition in Beijing, and the turning point occurred around 2010. This transition is widely observed in the variation in total embodied emission, total system throughflow, boundary flow and system capacity. Continuing improvement in efficiency is expected to lessen the pressure from carbonization in 2020 and 2030 without sacrificing the diversity of economic activities.

764,WOS:000359875100015,"Hybrid and electric powertrains and alternative fuels (e.g., compressed natural gas (CNG), biodiesel, or hydrogen) can often reduce energy consumption and emissions from transit bus operations relative to conventional diesel. However, the magnitude of these energy and emissions savings can vary significantly, due to local conditions and transit operating characteristics. This paper introduces the transit Fuel and Emissions Calculator (FEC), a mode-based life-cycle emissions modeling tool for transit bus and rail technologies that compares the performance of multiple alternative fuels and powertrains across a range of operational characteristics and conditions. The purpose of the FEC is to provide a practical, yet technically sophisticated tool for regulatory agencies and policy analysts in assessing transit fleet options. The FEC's modal modeling approach estimates emissions as a function of engine load, which in turn is a function of transit service parameters, including duty cycle (idling and speed-acceleration profile), road grade, and passenger loading. This approach allows for customized assessments that account for local conditions. Direct emissions estimates are derived from the scaled tractive power (STP) operating mode bins and emissions factors employed in the U.S. EPA's MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator) model. Life-cycle emissions estimates are calculated using emissions factors from the GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) model. The case study presented in this paper applies the FEC to second-by-second GPS position data collected from buses operating in metropolitan Atlanta, GA. These operations, from two different transit agencies, feature distinctly different transit service types: local transit bus operations and longer-distance express bus operations. The results illustrate that the decision as to which bus technology-fuel combination produces the least greenhouse gas emissions is a function of location and route characteristics. For the express bus operations monitored, the case study shows that CNG vehicles offer greater emissions reductions than Biodiesel (B20). For local bus services, battery electric buses show the greatest emissions savings in the fuel cycle, as long as range limitations can be met for the specific routes. The amount of these emissions savings is, however, highly dependent on the power generation mix. Among CNG, B20, parallel hybrid, series hybrid, and fuel cell buses, the least emitting option varies by location, due to complex interactions of factors such as duty cycle, meteorology, and terrain.

765,WOS:000328796900043,"Climate change is expected to increase global mean temperatures leading to higher tropospheric ozone (O-3) concentrations in already polluted regions, potentially eroding the benefits of expensive emission controls. The magnitude of the ""O-3-climate penalty"" has generally decreased over the past three decades, which makes future predictions for climate impacts on air quality uncertain. Researchers attribute historical reductions in the O-3-climate penalty to reductions in NOx emissions but have so far not extended this theory into a quantitative prediction for future effects. Here, we show that a three-dimensional air quality model can be used to map the behavior of the O-3-climate penalty under varying NOx and VOC emissions in both NOx-limited and NOx-saturated conditions in Central and Southern California, respectively. Simulations suggest that the planned emissions control program for O-3 precursors will not diminish the O-3-climate penalty to zero as some observational studies might imply. The results further demonstrate that in a NOx-limited air basin, NOx control strategies alone are sufficient to both decrease the O-3-climate penalty and mitigate O-3 pollution, while in a NOx-saturated air basin, a modified emissions control plan that carefully chooses reductions in both NOx and VOC emissions may be necessary to eliminate the O-3-climate penalty while simultaneously reducing base case O-3 concentrations to desired levels. Additional modeling is needed to determine the behavior of the O-3-climate penalty as NOx and VOC emissions evolve in other regions.","Rasmussen, DJ, Hu, JL, Mahmud, A, Kleeman, MJ",14,Davao,PHL,10.1021/es403446m,SRID=4326;POINT (125.61278 7.07306),1212504,"The Ozone-Climate Penalty: Past, Present, and Future",2013

767,WOS:000263690600009,"It is now accepted that some human-induced climate change is unavoidable. Potential impacts on water supply have received much attention, but relatively little is known about the concomitant changes in water quality. Projected changes in air temperature and rainfall could affect river flows and, hence, the mobility and dilution of contaminants. Increased water temperatures will affect chemical reaction kinetics and, combined with deteriorations in quality, freshwater ecological status. With increased flows there will be changes in stream power and, hence, sediment loads with the potential to alter the morphology of rivers and the transfer of sediments to lakes, thereby impacting freshwater habitats in both lake and stream systems. This paper reviews such impacts through the lens of UK surface water quality. Widely accepted climate change scenarios suggest more frequent droughts in summer, as well as flash-flooding, leading to uncontrolled discharges from urban areas to receiving water courses and estuaries. Invasion by alien species is highly likely, as is migration of species within the UK adapting to changing temperatures and flow regimes. Lower flows, reduced velocities and, hence, higher water residence times in rivers and lakes will enhance the potential for toxic algal blooms and reduce dissolved oxygen levels. Upland streams could experience increased dissolved organic carbon and colour levels, requiring action at water treatment plants to prevent toxic by-products entering public water supplies. Storms that terminate drought periods will flush nutrients from urban and rural areas or generate acid pulses in acidified upland catchments. Policy responses to climate change, such as the growth of bio-fuels or emission controls, will further impact freshwater quality.","Whitehead, PG, Wilby, RL, Battarbee, RW, Kernan, M, Wade, AJ",271,Upland,USA,10.1623/hysj.54.1.101,SRID=4326;POINT (-117.64839 34.09751),76443,A review of the potential impacts of climate change on surface water quality,2009

To retain local food production, advocates have called for the implementation of farmland protection policies that restrict urban development, such as exclusion zoning. Many such policies have been abandoned due to protests, often from the very people the policies are ostensibly intended to protect - farmers. Examining the failure of Sydney's latest green zones' through a political ecology lens, this paper challenges the prevailing narrative that these protests indicate a lack of community support for the ideal of farmland protection. The failure of the green zones was one of political process, specifically the lack of consultation with Sydney's culturally and linguistically diverse small-scale farmers, rather than community rejection of the principle of protection. Interview responses from farmers suggest that a bottom-up approach to policy-making would have yielded alternative and more successful approaches to maintaining farming on the fringe.

These cases show that there is significant potential for cities to further global climate justice through emission reductions while enhancing social justice locally.

772,WOS:000403028500057,"Waste management in cities has proved to be a complex task for policy-makers who seek cost reductions when taking decisions. However, on many occasions substantial environmental gain can be attained through waste management optimization. In this particular study, the main objective was to combine operational research techniques with Life Cycle Assessment to locate collection sites for general and recyclable residues and create an effective collection-route system for compactor trucks to attain a reduction in environmental impacts. The case study selected was the district of Comas, one of the most populated districts in the city of Lima, a city that has experienced several episodes of poor waste collection management in recent years. For the location of the collection sites a mathematical optimization model was proposed to decide where to locate them, as well as the number of containers required at each site, considering that general and recyclable residues would not be collected at the same site due to the restricted space available. For the creation of collection routes, a heuristic approach based on the Vehicle Routing Problem was constructed, taking into account the available working time of each collection truck to assign them collection routes and minimize the number of compactor trucks. These results, when combined with LCA, focused mainly on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollution impact categories and the depletion of abiotic resources. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was developed by varying three different parameters with respect to the proposed baseline scenario, comparing the several impact categories. Computed results show that implementing a container collection system reduces the number of compactor trucks required by up to 50% as compared to the current door-to-door collection system. Moreover, GHG emissions where reduced by almost 14% with the proposal, mostly due to a 41% reduction in distance traveled. Reductions in terms of particulate matter formation and photochemical oxidant formation were even more significant, especially considering that air pollution is an important health hazard in the district analyzed, whereas most scenarios showed a slight increase in resource depletion due to the inclusion of container infrastructure in the system.

We discuss how this is related to particular sources of resistance, such as affective attachment to wood heating and sociocultural norms. The research draws on six focus groups with participants from households with and without wood heating.

Such discourses also emphasise the identity of the town as a rural community and the supposed gemeinschaft qualities of such places.

This methodology involves an analysis of the impact pathways, starting with the emissions (e.g., g/km. of particles from tailpipe), followed by local and regional dispersion (e.g., incremental mug/m(3) of particles), calculation of the physical impacts using exposure-response functions (e.g., cases of respiratory hospital admissions), and finally multiplication by unit costs factors (e.g., Euro per hospital admission). Damages are aggregated over all affected receptors in Europe. In addition to the local and regional dispersion calculations carried out so far by ExternE, we also consider the increased microscale impacts due to the trapping of pollutants in street canyons, using numerical simulations with the FLUENT software.

777,WOS:000373700800017,"Trees provide numerous benefits for urban residents, including reduced energy usage, improved air quality, stormwater management, carbon sequestration, and increased property values. Quantifying these benefits can help justify the costs of planting trees. In this paper, we use i-Tree Streets to quantify the benefits of street trees planted by nonprofits in three U.S. cities (Detroit, Michigan; Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) from 2009 to 2011. We also use both measured and modeled survival and growth rates to ""grow"" the tree populations 5 and 10 years into the future to project the future benefits of the trees under different survival and growth scenarios. The 4059 re-inventoried trees (2864 of which are living) currently provide almost $40,000 (USD) in estimated annual benefits ($9-$20/tree depending on the city), the majority (75%) of which are increased property values. The trees can be expected to provide increasing annual benefits during the 10 years after planting if the annual survival rate is higher than the 93% annual survival measured during the establishment period. However, our projections show that with continued 93% or lower annual survival, the increase in annual benefits from tree growth will not be able to make up for the loss of benefits as trees die. This means that estimated total annual benefits from a cohort of planted trees will decrease between the 5-year projection and the 10-year projection. The results of this study indicate that without early intervention to ensure survival of planted street trees, tree mortality may be significantly undercutting the ability of tree-planting programs to provide benefits to neighborhood residents.","Widney, S, Fischer, BC, Vogt, J",2,Indianapolis; Philadelphia; Detroit,USA; USA; USA,10.3390/f7030065,SRID=4326;POINT (-86.15804 39.76838); SRID=4326;POINT (-75.16379000000001 39.95233); SRID=4326;POINT (-83.04575 42.33143),829718; 1567442; 677116,Tree Mortality Undercuts Ability of Tree-Planting Programs to Provide Benefits: Results of a Three-City Study,2016

To improve efficiency in carbon emission reduction, and enhance adaptability of cities to climate change, it is essential to undertake accounting of urban carbon cycle. This plays a prominent role in global carbon cycle. An integrated accounting framework for urban carbon cycle was established herein to support uniform accounting and place-specific comparisons, covering natural and artificial carbon cycles, vertical and horizontal carbon flows, carbon storage and fluxes, and carbon inputs and outputs:Guangyuan, a mountainous city in China that was seriously stricken by Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, was chosen as the case to demonstrate the framework and investigate the effects of postearthquake reconstruction on carbon cycle. The results show: 1) the proposed framework could effectively assess dynamics of carbon cycle under external disturbances, 2) there were abundant vegetation and correspondingly a large natural carbon tank and vertical carbon input, and low industrialization degree and correspondingly small horizontal and vertical carbon outputs in Guangyuan, 3) the postearthquake reconstruction led to a series of impacts on carbon cycle, from both aspects of amount and structure, and 4) such impacts of post-earthquake construction on artificial carbon cycle were distinct with a tendency toward low-carbon development in Guangyuan.

780,WOS:000388580000033,"Over the past three decades, China's economy has witnessed remarkable growth, with an average annual growth rate over 9%. However, China also faces great challenges to balance this spectacular economic growth and continuously increasing energy use like many other economies in the world. With the aim of designing effective energy and environmental policies, policymakers are required to master the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. Therefore, in the case of North China, a multivariate model employing panel data analysis method based on the Cobb-Douglas production function which introduces electricity consumption as a main factor was established in this paper. The equilibrium relationship and causal relationship between real GDP, electricity consumption, total investment in fixed assets, and the employment were explored using data during the period of 1995-2014 for six provinces in North China, including Beijing City, Tianjin City, Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, Shandong Province and Inner Mongolia. The results of panel co-integration tests clearly state that all variables are co-integrated in the long term. Finally, Granger causality tests were used to examine the causal relationship between economic growth, electricity consumption, labor force and capital. From the Granger causality test results, we can draw the conclusions that: (1) There exist bi-directional causal relationships between electricity consumption and real GDP in six provinces except Hebei; and (2) there is a bi-directional relationship between capital input and economic growth and between labor force input and economic growth except Beijing and Hebei. Therefore, the ways to solve the contradiction of economic growth and energy consumption in North China are to reduce fossil energy consumption, develop renewable and sustainable energy sources, improve energy efficiency, and increase the proportion of the third industry, especially the sectors which hold the characteristics of low energy consumption and high value-added.","Zhao, HR, Han, XY, He, ZH, Guo, S",1,Beijing,CHN,10.3390/en9110891,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,"Economic Growth, Electricity Consumption, Labor Force and Capital Input: A More Comprehensive Analysis on North China Using Panel Data",2016
781,WOS:000271240500013,"Ambient aerosols play an important role in atmospheric processes affecting the human and natural environments. They affect air quality, reduce visibility, and induce climate change by directly scattering and/or absorbing the incoming solar radiation (Charlson et al., 1992; Kim et al., 2006), or indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (Hobbs, 1993). Aerosol particles are emitted from a variety of anthropogenic and natural sources either directly into the atmosphere or as secondary particles by gas-to-particle formation process. There is growing interest in studying and analysing the mechanisms of formation of secondary particles. The development of new instruments during the 1990s to measure the particle size distribution of nanoparticles (<50 nm) has enabled scientists to observe the formation and growth of new particles (see Kulmala et al. (2004) for review). Nucleation events, that is, the appearance of a mode below 25-30 nm in the particle number size distribution, known as ""nucleation mode"" (e. g. Dal Maso et al., 2007; Tunved et al., 2003), usually in very large numbers, have been observed around the world. For example, they have been reported in remote (e. g. Tunved et al., 2003), urban (e. g. Jeong et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004) and coastal areas (e. g. Vaattovaara et al., 2006) and at various latitudes in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere (Lee et al., 2003). It has been shown that the probability of nucleation was increased by elevated sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) concentrations (Stanier et al., 2004). This gas is mainly emitted from anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of sulphur-containing fossil fuel (Stern, 2005). Therefore, aerosol nucleation in the atmosphere would be expected to be enhanced by human activities (see also Curtius (2006) for discussion). In urban air, morning nucleation events have been found to be consistent with peaks in traffic (Jeong et al., 2004). In contrast, in coastal environments, higher concentrations of nucleation mode particles have been observed during entries of clean air rather than of polluted air (O'Dowd et al., 2002). This is also confirmed by a Finish study (Spracklen et al., 2006), which found that particle concentrations in remote continental regions are dominated by nucleated particles whereas in polluted continental regions are dominated by primary particles. This paper aims to analyse the frequency of and the atmospheric conditions favourable for nucleation events at coastal urban location in Brisbane, Australia, with a focus on the contribution of vehicle emissions. Monitoring was conducted during four campaigns of two weeks duration each, and a campaign of four weeks duration, covering a total period of 13 months. The objective was to investigate which meteorological conditions enhanced the probability of nucleation and to investigate any patterns in gaseous concentrations leading to the events to determine whether the local traffic was a major source of secondary particles in the study area.","Mejia, JF, Morawska, L",9,Brisbane; Hobbs,AUS; USA,10.5194/acp-9-7877-2009,SRID=4326;POINT (153.02809 -27.46794); SRID=4326;POINT (-103.13604 32.70261),2189878; 38416,An investigation of nucleation events in a coastal urban environment in the Southern Hemisphere,2009
782,WOS:000166678100004,"Concern about climate change has evoked interest in the potential for urban vegetation to help reduce the levels of atmospheric carbon. This study applied computer simulations to try to quantify the modifying effects of existing vegetation on the indirect reduction of atmospheric carbon for two residential neighborhoods in north-west Chicago. The effects of shading, evapotranspiration, and windspeed reduction were considered and were found to have decreased carbon emissions by 3.2 to 3.9% per year for building types in study block I where tree cover was 33%, and -0.2 to 3.8% in block 2 where free cover was 11%. This resulted in a total annual reduction of carbon emission averaging 158.7 (+/-12.8) kg per residence in block I and 18.1 (+/-5.4) kg per residence in block 2. Windspeed reduction greatly contributed to the decrease of carbon emission. However, shading increased annual carbon emission from the combined change in heating and cooling energy use due to many frees in the wrong locations, which increase heating energy use during the winter The increase of carbon emission from shading is somewhat specific to Chicago, due in part to the large amount of clean, nuclear-generated cooling energy and the long heating season. In Chicago, heating energy is required for about eight months from October to May and cooling energy is used for the remaining 4 months from June to September If fossil fuels had been the primary source for cooling energy and the heating season had been shorter, the shading effects on the reduction of carbon emission would be greater. Planting of large frees close to the west wall of buildings, dense planting on the north, and avoidance of planting on the south are recommended to maximize indirect carbon reduction by residential vegetation, in Chicago and other mid and high-latitude cities with long heating seasons.

It takes into account both energy saving and punctuality at the same time, which is the goal of the most operators. In this study, the effect of employing variable regenerative energy recovery rate (RERR) for each inter-station was shown in energy-efficient operation improvement. For this purpose, a two-stage optimisation was proposed. In the first stage, which is a mechanical optimisation, optimal speed profiles for a single train were determined by a bi-objective optimisation through a non-dominated sorting algorithm. In this stage, a simulation model for determination of train's performance was developed and utilised. It was shown that variable RERRs eventually led to different energy-time Pareto fronts. In the second stage, the total input energy for a multi-train system was minimised by using obtained optimal speed profiles from the first stage and distributing total travelling time among inter-stations (electrical/electromechanical optimisation).

The present study addresses the estimation of black carbon aerosol scavenging coefficient by using ground-based measurements over an urban environment of India, namely, Hyderabad. Extensive ground measurements of black carbon have been carried out during January to December 2004 over a tropical urban environment of Hyderabad. Seasonal variations of black carbon aerosol mass concentration showed high values during dry season and low values during monsoon season. The diurnal variations of BC suggest that the concentrations increased by a factor of similar to 2 during morning and evening hours compared to afternoon hours. Drastic reduction in black carbon aerosol loading has been observed during rainy days. The statistical fit between black carbon aerosol mass concentration and rainfall suggests the reduction of similar to 3.6 mu g/m(3) in atmospheric black carbon aerosol loading for every 1-mm increase in rainfall intensity over the study area. The scavenging coefficient of black carbon aerosols is found to be 1.64 x 10(-5) s(-1). (C) Crown Copyright 2005. Reproduced with the permission of Her Majesty's Stationery Office.

786,WOS:000246119700003,"Background, Aim and Scope. Air quality is a field of major concern in large cities. This problem has led administrations to introduce plans and regulations to reduce pollutant emissions. The analysis of variations in the concentration of pollutants is useful when evaluating the effectiveness of these plans. However, such an analysis cannot be undertaken using standard statistical techniques, due to the fact that concentrations of atmospheric pollutants often exhibit a lack of normality and are autocorrelated. On the other hand, if long-term trends of any pollutant's emissions are to be detected, meteorological effects must be removed from the time series analysed, due to their strong masking effects. Materials and Methods. The application of statistical methods to analyse temporal variations is illustrated using monthly carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations observed at an urban site. The sampling site is located at a street intersection in central Valencia (Spain) with a high traffic density. Valencia is the third largest city in Spain. It is a typical Mediterranean city in terms of its urban structure and climatology. The sampling site started operation in January 1994 and monitored CO ground level concentrations until February 2002. Its geographic coordinates are W0 degrees 22'52 '' N39 degrees 28'05 '' and its altitude is I I in. Two nonparametric trend tests are applied. One of these is robust against serial correlation with regards to the false rejection rate, when observations have a strong persistence or when the sample size per month is small. A nonparametric analysis of the homogeneity of trends between seasons is also discussed. A multiple linear regression model is used with the transformed data, including the effect of meteorological variables. The method of generalized least squares is applied to estimate the model parameters to take into account the serial dependence of the residuals of this model. This study also assesses temporal changes using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter. The KZ filter has been shown to be an effective way to remove the influence of meteorological conditions on 03 and PM to examine underlying trends. Results. The nonparametric tests indicate a decreasing, significant trend in the sampled site. The application of the linear model yields a significant decrease every twelve months of 15.8% for the average monthly CO concentration. The 95% confidence interval for the trend ranges from 13.9% to 17.7%. The seasonal cycle also provides significant results. There are no differences in trends throughout the months. The percentage of CO variance explained by the linear model is 90.3%. The KZ filter separates out long, short-term and seasonal variations in the CO series. The estimated, significant, long-term trend every year results in 10.3% with this method. The 95% confidence interval ranges from 8.8% to 11.9%. This approach explains 89.9% of the CO temporal variations. Discussion. The differences between the linear model and KZ filter trend estimations are due to the fact that the KZ filter performs the analysis on the smoothed data rather than the original data. In the KZ filter trend estimation, the effect of meteorological conditions has been removed. The CO short-term component is attributable to weather and short-term fluctuations in emissions. There is a significant seasonal cycle. This component is a result of changes in the traffic, the yearly meteorological cycle and the interactions between these two factors. There are peaks during the autumn and winter months,which have more traffic density in the sampled site. There is a minimum during the month of August, reflecting the very low level of vehicle emissions which is a direct consequence of the holiday period. Conclusions. The significant, decreasing trend implies to a certain extent that the urban environment in the area is improving. This trend results from changes in overall emissions, pollutant transport, climate, policy and economics. It is also due to the effect of introducing reformulated gasoline. The additives enable vehicles to burn fuel with a higher air/fuel ratio, thereby lowering the emission of CO. The KZ filter has been the most effective method to separate the CO series components and to obtain an estimate of the long-term trend due to changes in emissions, removing the effect of meteorological conditions. Recommendations and Perspectives. Air quality managers and policy-makers must understand the link between climate and pollutants to select optimal pollutant reduction strategies and avoid exceeding emission directives. This paper analyses eight years of ambient CO data at a site with a high traffic density, and provides results that are useful for decision-making. The assessment of long-term changes in air pollutants to evaluate reduction strategies has to be done while taking into account meteorological variability.","Capilla, C",2,Valencia,VEN,10.1065/espr2006.09.342,SRID=4326;POINT (-68.00765 10.16202),1385083,Analysis of the trend and seasonal cycle of carbon monoxide concentration in an urban area,2007

The energy consumption of the three rooms was measured from September 2014 to September 2015 by monitoring the energy performance (temperature distributions of the roofs, evaporation, heat fluxes, and energy consumption) and indoor air temperature. The rooms had the same construction and appliances, except that one roof top was black, one was white, and one had a sedum-tray garden roof. This study references the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) to calculate and compare the energy savings of the three kinds of roofs. The results indicate that the energy savings ratios of the rooms with the sedum-tray garden roof and with the white roof were 25.0% and 20.5%, respectively, as compared with the black-roofed room, in the summer; by contrast, the energy savings ratios were -9.9% and -2.7%, respectively, in the winter. Furthermore, Annual conditioning energy savings of white roof (3.9 kWh/m(2)) were 1.6 times the energy savings for the sedum-tray garden roof.

As a developing country, China has great differences in regional economic development, which makes it necessary to implement the ecological compensation of regional carbon emissions to coordinate the relationship between regional economic development and environmental protection. Using the ecological system in Hunan Province, China as the research object, this study analyzed and calculated the carbon emissions and carbon sequestration across different industries and different regions of Hunan using ArcGIS and theoretical model calculation methods. Quantitative research on region ecological compensation was undertaken by establishing the ecological compensation coefficient and ecological compensation model based on the carbon-neutral principal. The results showed that there were significant differences in carbon sources and carbon sequestration in the different cities. Out of all the cities investigated, Changsha had the highest carbon emissions and Huaihua had the largest carbon sequestration. In terms of per capita, Xiangtan had the highest carbon emissions and Zhangjiajie had the largest carbon sequestration. Through the quantification of carbon compensation in the cities of Hunan, we found that Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Hengyang, Yueyang, and Loudi were in a state of ecological deficit, and should pay an amount of ecological compensation, respectively. Meanwhile, the other eight cities (Shaoyang, Changde, Zhangjiajie, Yiyang, Chenzhou, Yongzhou, Huaihua, and Xiangxi) were in a state of ecological surplus; they could receive some ecological compensation, respectively. Our results will provide a reference for areal carbon trading and ecological compensation mechanisms as significant instruments and measures to realize payment for environmental resource services.","Yu, GH, Liu, D, Liao, XY, Wang, T, Tian, QJ, Liao, Y",0,Xiangtan; Zhuzhou; Huaihua; Hengyang; Loudi; Changsha; Zhangjiajie; Yiyang; Chenzhou; Changde,CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN; CHN,10.3390/su9071095,SRID=4326;POINT (112.9 27.85); SRID=4326;POINT (113.15 27.83333); SRID=4326;POINT (110.00404 27.56337); SRID=4326;POINT (112.61888 26.88946); SRID=4326;POINT (111.99444 27.73444); SRID=4326;POINT (112.97087 28.19874); SRID=4326;POINT (110.47833 29.12944); SRID=4326;POINT (112.32833 28.58917); SRID=4326;POINT (113.03333 25.8); SRID=4326;POINT (111.6783 29.04638),674189; 709358; 127322; 759602; 150684; 3093980; 86083; 202608; 179038; 517780,"Quantitative Research on Regional Ecological Compensation from the Perspective of Carbon-Neutral: The Case of Hunan Province, China",2017

This study develops a model based on the multivariate econometric approach that considers these parameters to forecast and manage the MSW. The model applies statistical tools to select suitable function and most relevant explanatory variables that have strong relationship with solid waste generation. The model applicability is demonstrated with an example of MSW generation in Mashhad, Iran. The results indicate that the number of employees, population, household income, and temperature are significant variables of MSW generation in Mashhad. Socio-economic variables have been evaluated so far, but the impact of climatic factors is not considerably assessed in the previous studies. Thus, in this study, for the first time, the impact of temperature as a significant variable on MSW generation is assessed.

Meanwhile, the development of automobile oriented neighborhood structures, such as superblock housing, currently dominates urban expansion, and construction in Chinese cities. This research takes an empirical approach to understanding the relationship between neighborhood type and household travel energy use in Jinan, China, by examining nine neighborhoods that represent the four types of urban community commonly found in Chinese cities: traditional, grid, enclave, and superblock. After conducting a survey, we derive disaggregate household transport energy uses from the' self-reported weekly travel diaries. Comparative analysis and two-step instrumental variable models are employed. Results show that, all else being equal, households located in superblock neighborhoods consume more transportation energy than those in other neighborhood types, because such households tend to own more cars and travel longer distances. Proximity to transit corridors and greater distance from the city center are also associated with higher household transport energy use in these neighborhoods, although both impacts are minor, partially because of the offsetting effects of car ownership. Overall, the analysis suggests that, to help chart a more energy-efficient future in urban China, policymakers should (1) examine past neighborhood designs to find alternatives to the superblock, (2) focus on strategic infill development, (3) encourage greater use of bicycles and e-bikes as a substitute for larger motorized vehicles, (4) improve the efficiency of public transportation, and (5) consider ways to shape citizens' preferences for more energy-efficient modes of travel.","Jiang, Y, Zegras, PC, He, DQ, Mao, QZ",2,Jinan,CHN,10.1007/s11027-014-9618-8,SRID=4326;POINT (116.99722 36.66833),4335989,"Does energy follow form?

796,WOS:000424727100021,"Cities can play a key role in the low-carbon transition, with an increasing number of cities engaging in carbon mitigation actions. The literature on urban low-carbon transition shows that low-carbon urban development is an inevitable trend of urban sustainable future; there is a great potential albeit with some limitations for cities to reduce its carbon footprints, and there are diverse pathways for cities to achieve low-carbon development. There is, however, a limited understanding in terms of the internal mechanism of urban low-carbon transition, especially in rapidly developing economies. This paper attempts to address this gap. We examine how low-carbon policies emerge and evolve, and what are the enabling mechanisms, taking Shanghai as a case study. We developed an analytical framework drawing on system innovation theory and sustainability experiments for this purpose. A total of 186 relevant policies were selected and analyzed, which is supplemented by the interviews with stakeholders in the government to gain a deeper insight into the policy contexts in Shanghai. We found that the city's low carbon initiatives are embedded and integrated into its existing policy frameworks. A strong vertical linkage between the central and the local governments, and more importantly, a nested structure for innovative policy practices were identified, where a top-down design is met with bottom-up innovation and proactive adoption of enabling mechanism. The structure includes two layers of experiments that facilitate learning through policy experiments across scales. The uniqueness, effectiveness, applicability and limitations of these efforts are discussed. The findings provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the multilevel governance of low-carbon transition in cities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Differing from the long-term strategic problems (e.g., the two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), the two echelon location routing problem (2E-LRP) and the truck and trailer routing problem (TTRP)) that make location decisions in depots or satellites, the paper introduces a short-term tactical problem named the two-echelon time-constrained vehicle routing problem in linehaul-delivery systems (2E-TVRP) considering carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The linehaul level and the delivery level are linked through city distribution centers (CDCs). The 2E-TVRP, which takes CO2 emissions per ton-kilometer as the objective, has inter-CDC linehaul on the 1st level and delivery from CDCs to satellites on the 2nd level. The Clarke and Wright savings heuristic algorithm (CW) improved by a local search phase is put forward. The case study shows the applicability of the model to real-life problems.

The embodied energy of buildings and the transport energy consumption of their users are typically overlooked. Recent studies have shown that these two energy demands can represent more than half of the life cycle energy over 50 years. This article presents a framework which takes into account energy requirements at the building scale, i.e. the embodied and operational energy of the building and its refurbishment, and at the city scale, i.e. the embodied energy of nearby infrastructures and the transport energy (direct and indirect) of its users. This framework has been implemented through the development of a software tool which allows the rapid analysis of the life cycle energy demand of buildings at different scales. Results from two case studies, located in Brussels, Belgium and Melbourne. Australia, confirm that each of the embodied, operational and transport requirements are nearly equally important. By integrating these three energy flows, the developed framework and software provide building designers, planners and decision makers with a powerful tool to effectively reduce the overall energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions of residential buildings.

Greenhouse gas emission reduction targets have been set in many industrialised countries. A change in current practices of almost all greenhouse-emitting industrial sectors is unavoidable, if the set targets is to be achieved. Although, waste disposal contributes around 3% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Australia (mainly due to fugitive methane emissions from landfills), the carbon credit and trading scheme set to start in 2010 presents significant challenges and opportunities to municipal solid waste practitioners. Technological advances in waste management, if adopted properly, allow the municipal solid waste sector to act as carbon sink, hence earning tradable carbon credits. However, due to the complexity of the system and its inherent uncertainties, optimizing it for carbon credits may worsen its performance under other criteria. We use an integrated, stochastic multi-criteria decision-making tool that we developed earlier to analyse the carbon credit potential of Sydney municipal solid waste under eleven possible future strategies.

In the South, local coping strategies are an important element of adaptation to climate and disaster risk. Such strategies have emerged because of the limited assistance provided by urban actors and associated social security and governance systems. In the North, in contrast, local coping strategies are comparatively poorly developed. However, the extent of the changing climatic conditions is also reducing the capacity of Northern institutions to deal with climatic extremes and variability, which emphasises the need for more local-level engagement in the North.

Energy efficiency, renewable energy, urban design, price- and behavioral-feedback strategies are evaluated across buildings-facilities, transportation, and materials/waste sectors in cities, comparing voluntary versus regulatory action configurations. GHG mitigation impact depends upon strategy effectiveness per unit, as well as societal participation rates in various action-configurations. Greatest impact occurs with regulations addressing the vast existing buildings stock in cities, followed by voluntary behavior change in electricity use/purchases, technology shifts (e.g., to teleconferencing), and green-energy purchases among individual users. A portfolio mix of voluntary and regulatory actions can yield a best-case maximum of similar to 1% GHG mitigation annually in buildings and transportation sectors, combined. Relying solely on voluntary actions reduces mitigation rates more than five-fold. A portfolio analysis of climate action plans in 55 U.S. cities reveals predominance of voluntary outreach programs that have low societal participation rates and hence low GHG impact, while innovative higher-impact behavioral, technological, and policy/regulatory strategies are under-utilized.

The results demonstrate that the effect of residential self-selection also exists in Chinese cities, influencing residents' choice of living environments and ultimately affecting their commute trip CO2 emissions. After controlling for the effect of residential self-selection, built environment variables still have significant effects on CO2 emissions from commuting although some are indirect effects that work through mediating variables (car ownership and commuting trip distance). Specifically, CO2 emissions are negatively affected by land-use mix, residential density, metro station density and road network density.

Sustainable transportation, and especially cycling, can contribute to the mitigation of CO(2) emissions since cycling possesses an intrinsic zero-emission value. Few studies have been conducted that appraise the CO(2) reduction potential of cycling. Opportunity costs enable the estimation of avoided CO(2) emissions resulting from bicycle trips. The methodology developed in this research allows the attribution of a climate value to cycling by substituting bicycle trips with their most likely alternative transportation modes and calculating the resulting additional CO(2) emissions. The methodology uses data on the current modal shares of cycling mobility, the competition of cycling with other transportation modes, and CO(2) emission factors to calculate the climate value of cycling. When it is assumed that the avoided CO(2) emissions of cycling mobility could be traded on financial carbon markets, the climate value of cycling represents a monetary value. Application of the methodology to the case of Bogota, Colombia - a city with a current bicycle modal share of 3.3% on a total of 10 million daily trips - results in a climate value of cycling of 55,115 tons of CO(2) per year, corresponding to an economic value of between 1 and 7 million US dollars when traded on the carbon market.","Massink, R, Rijnsburger, J, Zuidgeest, M, Sarmiento, OL, van Maarseveen, M",6,DeSoto,USA,10.1111/j.1477-8947.2011.01345.x,SRID=4326;POINT (-96.85695 32.58986),52486,The Climate Value of Cycling,2011

The transport footprint can be reduced through more families using active and public transport, which can be encouraged by providing information, support and facilities and appropriate siting of new centres. Introducing the concept of ecological footprint in early childhood education may be an effective way to educate children, staff and parents on the links between the food they eat, land usage and environmental impact.

810,WOS:000340181200008,"This paper presents a methodology to estimate the economic, emissions, and energy benefits that could be obtained from a base loaded CHP system using screening parameters and system component efficiencies. On the basis of the location of the system and the facility power to heat ratio, the power that must be supplied by a base loaded CHP system in order to potentially achieve cost, emissions, or primary energy savings can be estimated. A base loaded CHP system is analyzed in nine US cities in different climate zones, which differ in both the local electricity generation fuel mix and local electricity prices. Its potential to produce economic, emissions, and energy savings is quantified on the basis of the minimum fraction of the useful heat to the heat recovered by the CHP system (phi(min)). The values for phi(min) are determined for each location in terms of cost, emissions, and energy. Results indicate that in terms of cost, four of the nine evaluated cities (Houston, San Francisco, Boulder, and Duluth) do not need to use any of the heat recovered by the CHP system to potentially generate cost savings. On the other hand, in cities such as Seattle, around 86% of the recovered heat needs to be used to potentially provide cost savings. In terms of emissions, only Chicago, Boulder, and Duluth are able to reduce emissions without using any of the recovered heat. In terms of primary energy consumption, only Chicago and Duluth do not require the use of any of the recovered heat to yield primary energy savings. For the rest of the evaluated cities, some of the recovered heat must be used in order to reduce the primary energy consumption with respect to the reference case. In addition, the effect of the efficiency of the power generation unit and the facility power to heat ratio on the potential of the CHP system to reduce cost, emissions, and primary energy is investigated, and a graphical method is presented for examining the trade-offs between power to heat ratio, base loading fraction, percentage of recovered heat used, and minimum ratios for cost, emissions, and primary energy.

These challenges necessitate a re-thinking of existing notions of urban governance in order to account for the practices that emerge from governments and a plethora of other actors in the context of uncertainty. We understand these practices to constitute adaptive governance, underpinned by social learning guiding the actions of the multiplicity of actors. The aim here is to unpack how social learning for adaptive governance requires attention to competing understandings of risk and identity, and the multiplicity of mechanisms in which change occurs or is blocked in urban climate governance. We adopt a novel lens of 'environmentalities' which allows us to assess the historical and institutional context and power relations in the informal settlements of Maputo, Mozambique. Our findings highlight how environmental identities around urban adaptation to climate change are constituted in the social and physical divisions between the formal and informal settlements, whilst existing knowledge models prioritise dominant economic and political interests and lead to the construction of new environmental subjects. While the findings of this study are contextually distinct, the generalizable lessons are that governance of urban adaptation occurs and is solidified within a complex multiplicity of socio-ecological relations.

Based on this calibration to idealised global warming scenarios with and without interactive atmosphere-ocean fluxes and freshwater perturbation simulations, we project the future evolution of the AMOC mean strength within the covered calibration range for the lower two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) until 2100 obtained from the reduced complexity carbon cycle-climate model MAGICC 6. For RCP3-PD with a global mean temperature median below 1.0 degrees C warming relative to the year 2000, we project an ensemble median weakening of up to 11% compared to 22% under RCP4.5 with a warming median up to 1.9 degrees C over the 21st century. Additional Greenland meltwater of 10 and 20 cm of global sea-level rise equivalent further weakens the AMOC by about 4.5 and 10 %, respectively. By combining our outcome with a multi-model sea-level rise study we project a dynamic sea-level rise along the New York City coastline of 4 cm for the RCP3-PD and of 8 cm for the RCP4.5 scenario over the 21st century. We estimate the total steric and dynamic sea-level rise for New York City to be about 24 cm until 2100 for the RCP3-PD scenario, which can hold as a lower bound for sea-level rise projections in this region, as it does not include ice sheet and mountain glacier contributions.","Schleussner, CF, Frieler, K, Meinshausen, M, Yin, J, Levermann, A",5,New York City,USA,10.5194/esd-2-191-2011,SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),8175133,Emulating Atlantic overturning strength for low emission scenarios: consequences for sea-level rise along the North American east coast,2011

These footprints, however, do not address risk posed to city energy supplies characterized by insufficient streamflow to support energy production, such as cooling water intake (e.g., withdrawals) at thermoelectric power plants. Water withdrawal intensity factors for producing goods and services are being developed at the national scale, but lack sufficient spatial resolution to address these types of water-energy challenges facing cities. To address this need, this article presents a water withdrawal footprint for energy supply (WWFES) to cities and places it in the context of other water footprints defined in the literature.

820,WOS:000374891300005,"We are witnessing increasing interests in developing ""smart cities"" which helps improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of a traditional city. An important aspect of developing smart cities is to enable ""smart transportation,"" which improves the efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability of city transportation means. Meanwhile, the increasing use of GPS devices has led to the emergence of big trajectory data that consists of large amounts of historical trajectories and real-time GPS data streams that reflect how the transportation networks are used or being used by moving objects, e.g., vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Such big trajectory data provides a solid data foundation for developing various smart transportation applications, such as congestion avoidance, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and effective traffic accident response, etc. Instead of proposing yet another specific smart transportation application, we propose the parallel-distributed network-constrained moving objects database (PD-NMOD), a general framework that manages big trajectory data in a scalable manner, which provides an infrastructure that is able to support a wide variety of smart transportation applications and thus benefiting the smart city vision as a whole. The PD-NMOD manages both transportation networks and trajectories in a distributed manner. In addition, the PD-NMOD is designed to support general SQL queries over moving objects and to efficiently process the SQL queries on big trajectory data in parallel. Such design facilitates smart transportation applications to retrieve relevant trajectory data and to conduct statistical analyses.

821,WOS:000256799000001,"Anaerobic digestion is a well known process that (while still capable of showing new features) has experienced several waves of technological development. It was ""born"" as a wastewater treatment system, in the 1970s showed promise as an alternative energy source (in particular from animal waste), in the 1980s and later it became a standard for treating organic-matter-rich industrial wastewater, and more recently returned to the market for its energy recovery potential, making use of different biomasses, including energy crops. With the growing concern around global warming, this paper looks at the potential of anaerobic digestion in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The potential contribution of anaerobic digestion to GHG reduction has been computed for the 27 EU countries on the basis of their 2005 Kyoto declarations and using life cycle data. The theoretical potential contribution of anaerobic digestion to Kyoto and EU post- Kyoto targets has been calculated. Two different possible biogas applications have been considered: electricity production from manure waste, and upgraded methane production for light goods vehicles (from landfill biogas and municipal and industrial wastewater treatment sludges). The useful heat that can be produced as by-product from biogas conversion into electricity has not been taken into consideration, as its real exploitation depends on local conditions. Moreover the amount of biogas already produced via dedicated anaerobic digestion processes has also not been included in the calculations. Therefore the overall gains achievable would be even higher than those reported here. This exercise shows that biogas may considerably contribute to GHG emission reductions in particular if used as a biofuel. Results also show that its use as a biofuel may allow for true negative GHG emissions, showing a net advantage with respect to other biofuels. Considering also energy crops that will become available in the next few years as a result of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, this study shows that biogas has the potential of covering almost 50% of the 2020 biofuel target of 10% of all automotive transport fuels, without implying a change in land use. Moreover, considering the achievable GHG reductions, a very large carbon emission trading ""value"" could support the investment needs. However, those results were obtained through a ""qualitative"" assessment. In order to produce robust data for decision makers, a quantitative sustainability assessment should be carried out, integrating different methodologies within a life cycle framework.

822,WOS:000376800000050,"Urban areas are the dominant source of U.S. fossil fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO2) emissions. In the absence of binding international treaties or decisive U.S. federal policy for greenhouse gas regulation, cities have also become leaders in greenhouse gas reduction efforts through climate action plans. These plans focus on anthropogenic carbon flows only, however, ignoring a potentially substantial contribution to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations from biological respiration. Our aim was to measure the contribution of CO2 efflux from soil respiration to atmospheric CO2 fluxes using an automated CO2 efflux system and to use these measurements to model urban soil CO2 efflux across an urban area. We find that growing season soil respiration is dramatically enhanced in urban areas and represents levels of CO2 efflux of up to 72% of FFCO2 within greater Boston's residential areas, and that soils in urban forests, lawns, and landscaped cover types emit 2.62 +/- 0.15, 4.49 +/- 0.14, and 6.73 +/- 0.26 mu molCO(2) m(-2) s(-1), respectively, during the growing season. These rates represent up to 2.2 times greater soil respiration than rates found in nearby rural ecosystems in central Massachusetts (MA), a potential consequence of imported carbon amendments, such as mulch, within a general regime of landowner management. As the scientific community moves rapidly towards monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 emissions using ground based approaches and remotely-sensed observations to measure CO2 concentrations, our results show that measurement and modeling of biogenic urban CO2 fluxes will be a critical component for verification of urban climate action plans.

Large uncertainties of BC optical properties, however, still exist and seriously restrict the ability to quantify BC's climate effects. In this study, advanced instrumentation (a three-wavelength photoacoustic soot spectrometer (PASS-3) and a single particle soot photometer (SP2)) were used to measure black carbon aerosol and analyze Its optical properties in a mega-city in South China, Shenzhen, during the summer of 2011. The results indicated that the average BC mass concentration was 4.0 +/- 3.1 mu g m(-3) during the campaign, accounting for similar to 11% of the total PM2.5 mass concentration. The PM2.5 light absorption at 405, 532 and 781 nm was 37.1 +/- 28.1, 25.4 +/- 19.0 and 17.6 +/- 12.9 Mm(-1), respectively. The average absorption Angstrom exponent of PM2.5 in visual spectrum (AAE(405-785 nm)) was 1.1 +/- 0.1 during the campaign, indicating that the light absorbing carbon mainly came from vehicular emissions, with little contributions from biomass burning emissions. The mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of BC at 532 nm ranged from 5.0 to 8.5 m(2) g(-1) during the campaign, with an average of 6.5 +/- 0.5 m(2) g(-1), and showed an obvious diurnal pattern with high values in the daytime. The average percentage of internally mixed BC was 24.3 +/- 7.9% during the campaign, showing significant positive correlation relationship with the MAE of BC.

A modified version of an algorithm developed by the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory is used to evaluate energy requirements. Energy loads for two buildings of interest are estimated for changing climatic conditions (air temperature) as well as changing environments around the building. An isolated building and a building surrounded by several other buildings are considered. Results indicate that climate warming may lead to energy savings in a wide range of climates while savings also depend on the nature of the building and its use. In cool climates, climate warming forces net energy-load decreases through reductions of the winter heating loads. For example, a one-degree increase in annual air temperature in Duluth led to a 10 k Wh decrease in net energy loads for a small office building. In warm climates, urbanization tends to accelerate energy consumption although shadowing may contribute significantly to decreases in summer cooling loads. In Phoenix, annual mean daily net energy loads decreased by about 10 k Wh due to shadowing for the same office building. Even in relatively cool regions, summer cooling-load reductions caused by shadowing are effective.","MATSUURA, K",6,Duluth,USA,10.1007/BF00865545,SRID=4326;POINT (-92.10657999999999 46.78327),86110,EFFECTS OF CLIMATE-CHANGE ON BUILDING ENERGY-CONSUMPTION IN CITIES,1995

The paper covers the data and methods, changes in atmospheric gas concentrations, the macroeconomic effects of the policies, and the outcome for pollution. The results suggest that in the conditions of underemployment in Mexico, substantial investment in low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps and geo-thermal power, could improve employment prospects, maintain growth, as well as reduce some of the risks associated with prospective falls in oil revenues.

In this case study TDR is developed as a hybrid instrument, aimed at regulating, motivating and negotiating at the same time. Its working strategy can be considered as an anomalous distributive policy which shares costs and benefits among the actors involved in the instrument implementation through a market-led mechanism, producing several possible types of outcomes. One of the main issues is that the capability of the instrument to self regulate itself during the implementation phase seems to be very hard to achieve.

That is why the reduction of energy consumption by increasing electrified urban transport, such as trams, trolleybuses, light rail and underground is becoming an increasingly important issue. Energy recovery during braking is possible in all modern electric vehicles, but in many cases this possibility is not fully taken advantage of, inter alia, because of an inadequate power supply structure. The aim of this article is to present practical examples of implementation of eco-friendly solutions in urban municipal transport. The article shows a thorough analysis of braking energy dispatch in the urban traction power supply system, which was based on extensive measurement research conducted in Gdynia trolleybus network. The authors applied multi way measurement method using Global Positioning System. The optimal conditions for implementation of several methods of energy recovery (storage energy systems, reconfiguration of supply system, using auxiliaries) have been shown.

829,WOS:000287777300002,"Appraisal of the greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of transportation system interventions, such as investments in bus rapid transit (BRT), is of growing interest to transportation and environmental officials, investors, and other stakeholders. The lack of an accepted methodology to estimate the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) mitigation potential from modal shift and reductions in vehicle kilometers traveled has inhibited access to GHG-related funding mechanisms. This paper focuses only on development of a common methodology for BRT projects with sufficient information to conduct analysis. Adjustment factors were postulated that might be used to estimate generalized BRT investment impacts in large, developing cities. Parameters were established on the basis of in-depth analyses of the CO(2) impacts on three BRT systems: those in Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City, Mexico; and Jakarta, Indonesia. An analysis of CO(2) emission reductions related to the Bogota BRT system secured Clean Development Mechanism certification for carbon financing in 2006 and followed a corridor-focused methodology. In 2007 to 2008, a regional, integrated transportation land use model was applied to BRT scenarios for Mexico City. Calculations have been updated on the basis of data from post-implementation passenger surveys. The methodology does not capture some potential sources of emissions savings, such as fuel consumption internal to the bus system. But even accounting for these differences, the Jakarta BRT system could produce much smaller WIG benefits. This paper reports on a preliminary effort to develop a reasonable methodology to estimate CO(2) abatement potential at the project level in a way that facilitates aggregation at the national and regional levels.","Hook, W, Kost, C, Navarro, U, Replogle, M, Baranda, B",8,Jakarta; Mexico City,IDN; MEX,10.3141/2193-02,SRID=4326;POINT (106.84513 -6.21462); SRID=4326;POINT (-99.12766000000001 19.42847),8540121; 12294193,"Carbon Dioxide Reduction Benefits of Bus Rapid Transit Systems Learning from Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City, Mexico; and Jakarta, Indonesia",2010
830,WOS:000407185900093,"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the potential to decrease greenhouse gas emissions given certain power generation profiles. The adoption of PHEVs is associated with significant social, economic, environmental, and health benefits. However, most researchers in literature generally estimate emissions using national averages of emission data. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap. Specifically, we estimated CO2 emissions of PHEVs using a life-cycle analysis in 8 Canadian cities (Vancouver, St John's, Charlottetown, Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Regina, and Calgary). We found that across Canada the varying electricity generation profiles affected the potential reduction benefit in life-cycle CO2 emissions. For example, 95% of the energy in the province of Alberta was generated from fossil fuels, which united a high amount of GHGs. Consequently, Calgary (city located in Alberta) had the highest CO2 life-cycle emissions for PHEVs, where electricity generation accounted for 61% of the total emissions. Conversely, the provinces of British Columbia (BC) and Quebec (QC) used 86% and 98% clean energy, respectively. The cities evaluated in our analysis that are located in these provinces (i.e., Vancouver, BC and Montreal, QC) presented the lowest CO2 emissions from electricity generation with less than 4% of the total PHEV emissions. Our study provides insight for policy makers about direct investment in EV incentives across Canada and where these incentives could be focused.

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters in this issue display the different scales and fields of planning, including planning for: disaster recovery; climate change, especially opportunities for mitigation; shrinking cities in the First World; and rapidly urbanising informal and impoverished cities in the global South. At the same time, the chapters identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Olshansky and Chang highlight the increasing losses from catastrophic disasters, and address the need for disaster recovery planning. Wheeler, Randolph and London focus on climate change, and, noting the urgency of action now, their research agenda emphasises opportunities for planners to develop research and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz and Popper look at increasing economic and population trends in many First World cities that result in city 'shrinkage'. They present new opportunities for improving cities' green space networks and natural features, and for research. The trebling of urban population in African cities by 2050, in conditions of poverty and informality, is the major trend driving Parnell, Pietriese and Watson's chapter.

This study shows how central Kyoto has become compact by an investigation of condominiums. An evaluation of CO2 emissions based on the supply of condominiums was carried out. The investigation shows that the supply of condominiums within the central district of Kyoto has been increasing faster than that in the fringe district recently. Travel distance and modes of transportation are changed by such compaction process. The estimation shows that compact housing arrangement, which shortens traveling distance and changes the transportation modes of residents, helps to reduce CO2 emission in Kyoto.

The energy used in homes for heating, cooking and running electrical appliances is responsible for a quarter of current total UK emissions and is a key target of government policies for greenhouse gas abatement. Policymakers need to understand the potential impact that such decarbonization policies have-on the indoor environment and health for a full assessment of costs and benefits. We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010-2050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy approaches in different locations, rather than adopting a universally rolled out strategy.

The method is applied to a case study in Stuttgart/Germany, while considering the specific building characteristics of the city quarter. Four different development scenarios to reach a similar building standard for all residential buildings are assessed, which include either the refurbishment or the demolition and reconstruction or a combination of both. The total reduction of the primary energy demand for building operation is the same in each scenario. However, different production and construction energy inputs are needed for the four scenarios, which are highest for new constructions. The end-of-life energy demand is negligible by comparison. This leads to the conclusion that from the life cycle energy point of view, refurbishment to a high building standard is better than reconstruction under the condition that the structural condition of the building allows it. If the plan is to refurbish or partially reconstruct all buildings in a city quarter, a specific order needs to be chosen. This order has a high influence on the temporal development of the energy demand reduction of the city quarter. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of research studies are now examining the potential for future lower CO2 emissions in the transport sector. This paper develops this work to consider some of the wider sustainability impacts (economic, social and local environmental) as well as the lower CO2 transport impacts of different policy trajectories. Hence the central argument made is for an integrated approach to transport policy making over the longer term - incorporating scenario analysis and multi-criteria assessment (MCA) - to help assess likely progress against a range of objectives. The analysis is based on work carried out in Oxfordshire, UK. Different packages of measures are selected and two scenarios developed which satisfy lower CO2 aspirations, one of which also provides wider positive sustainability impacts. A simulation model has been produced to help explore the strategic policy choices and tensions evident for decision-makers involved in local transport planning. The paper argues for a 'strategic conversation' (Van der Heijden, 1996) at the sub-regional and city level, based upon future scenario analysis and MCA, discussing the priorities for intervention.

The annual concentration of VOCs (96.2-121.1 ppbC) has shown a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2008, suggesting the control strategy via the ""Special Measures for Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement,"" which was implemented in 2005, has been successful. The contributions of individual VOC to the production of ambient ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are discussed to assess the adequacy of current control strategies. The contribution of aromatics (C6-C10) to the production of ozone accounted for 38.7-46.3 % of the total ozone production, followed by low carbon alkanes (C2-C6) (27.0-35.9 %). The total SOA formation potential of VOCs was found to range from 2.5 to 3.5 mu g m(-3), mainly as a result of aromatics (C6-C10) (over 85 %).

Thus, the current emission control strategy focused on these two emission sources is appropriate to reduce the VOCs related pollution level of the Seoul Metropolitan Region.

We found soils heavily loaded with OM emit significantly more CO2 than those that have received little or no OM. CH4 emissions from CCW are low compared to reference wetlands and show no relationship with the loading rate of added OM or total soil carbon. We conclude that adding moderate amounts (< similar to 150 kg m(-2)) of OM to the CCW does not greatly increase GHG emissions, while the addition of high amounts of OM produces additional CO2, but not CH4.

The premise of this approach is that the mainstreaming of the climate mitigation issue within the local level polices will result in various local environmental and non-environmental co-benefits in addition to a reduction of GHG emissions. The implementation of the co-benefits approach aims to strengthen the policy making process, which is identified as being especially important in context of developing cities. This paper attempts to confirm this by analyzing a planning process of and global and local benefits generated by an innovative project related to provision of bicycle parking. The paper firstly overviews recent co-benefits literature related to urban transport in general and active travel in particular, as well as evaluated benefits related to bicycle infrastructure provision. Then, taking the case of the Serbian city of Novi Sad, this paper examines local drivers behind the bicycle project implementation, the reduction of CO2 emission generated by the increase of cycle commuters, the project impact on individual commute behavior as well as potential for income generation. The results support arguments towards relevance of implementation of the co-benefits approach within processes of cycling planning and popularization, particularly highlighting the role and possibilities for implementation of co-benefits projects related to bicycle parking facilities.

840,WOS:000382794200035,"Building energy conservation measures (ECMs) can significantly lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from urban areas; however, uncertainties regarding not only ECM eligibility, but also associated costs and energy savings have slowed adoption of ECMs. To encourage ECM implementation, local governments have implemented a range of policies designed to increase the available information on building energy use. Energy audit mandates, such as New York City (NYC)'s Local Law 87 (LL87), require energy consultants to analyze installed building systems and provide building stakeholders with cost effective ECM recommendations on a multi-year cycle. However, complete audits are costly and time consuming. To accelerate ECM implementation, policymakers are exploring ways to utilize available data to target ECM5 across a city's entire building stock. In this study, energy audit data for over 1100 buildings in NYC, submitted in compliance with LL87, are analyzed to identify opportunities for ECMs across building system categories (e.g. distribution system, domestic hot water, etc.). A machine learning classifier, specifically a user-facing falling rule list (FRL) classifier based on binary features derived from LL87 data, is developed here to predict ECM eligibility given a specific set of building characteristics. Overall, the trained FRL classifier performs well (ROC AUC 0.72-0.86) for predicting cooling system, distribution system, domestic hot water, fuel switching, lighting, and motors ECM opportunities, which represent a majority of the auditor-recommended ECM5 in the sample. Additionally, linear decision lists developed by the model allow building stakeholders to easily conduct streamlined audits of building systems and identify possible ECM opportunities by limiting input to the most relevant factors and prioritizing likely retrofit candidates.

The implementation of improved sustainability measures in cities requires integrated thinking that encompasses a whole range of urban functions, often implying a major restructuring of urban energy systems, transport and the built environment, as well as a new approach to the planning and management of natural systems that service urban areas. Many local governments have a limited capacity to deal with such complex and interrelated problems, and this hampers their ability to deal with climate change. With these issues in mind, teams of scientists, practitioners and stakeholders in Durban (led by eThekwini Municipality) and London (led by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research) developed city-scale integrated assessment modelling tools that represent interactions between different urban functions and objectives by linking climate change issues to broader agendas such as spatial planning.

As such it presents a model on how international results and methodology can be adapted and used to calculate country-specific GHG emission factors from waste. For the collection and transport of municipal waste in South Africa, the average diesel consumption is around 5 dm(3) (litres) per tonne of wet waste and the associated GHG emissions are about 15 kg CO2 equivalents (CO2 e). Depending on the type of landfill, the GHG emissions from the landfilling of waste have been calculated to range from -145 to 1016 kg CO2 e per tonne of wet waste, when taking into account carbon storage, and from 441 to 2532 kg CO2 e per tonne of wet waste, when carbon storage is left out. The highest emission factor per unit of wet waste is for landfill sites without landfill gas collection and these are the dominant waste disposal facilities in South Africa. However, cash strapped municipalities in Africa and the developing world will not be able to significantly upgrade these sites and reduce their GHG burdens if there is no equivalent replacement of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) resulting from the Kyoto agreement. Other low cost avenues need to be investigated to suit local conditions, in particular landfill covers which enhance methane oxidation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban areas consume 75% of energy and produce the most greenhouse gases and pollution. The sustainability in urban built environment via improving efficiency in designing residential site and neighborhood, supports energy saving and pollution reduction. This paper tries to focus on distance to facilities to promote walkability in neighborhoods as the front line of sustainable movement in urban area. The study area is Subang Jaya Township in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with 155 neighborhoods. An empirical analysis was done to determine the factors that influence distance to facilities and daily necessary services in residential sites which support the increase of walkability and reduce car use and time used for accessibility to these services. The result shows density, land diversity, non residential land use, and employment influence the distance to facilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Some national and local Chinese building energy efficiency standards credit or recommend, but do not require, cool roofs or walls. EnergyPlus simulations of standard-compliant Chinese office and residential building prototypes in seven Chinese cities (Harbin, Changchun, Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou) showed that substituting an aged white roof (albedo 0.6) for an aged gray roof (albedo 0.2) yields positive annual load, energy, energy cost, CO2, NO., and SO2 savings in all hot-summer cities (Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou). Measurements in an office building in Chongqing in August 2012 found that a white coating lowered roof surface temperature by about 20 degrees C, and reduced daily air conditioning energy use by about 9%. Measurements in a naturally ventilated factory in Guangdong Province in August 2011 showed that a white coating decreased roof surface temperature by about 17 degrees C, lowered room air temperature by 1-3 degrees C, and reduced daily roof heat flux by 66%.

Proposed passenger transport projects have been cancelled in major cities, and completed projects have not attracted the private motorist. This study investigates reasons for this. As cities grow vertically and horizontally, they form three-dimensional mazes requiring special transport design solutions that enhance the city. Congestion can be alleviated by transferring passenger transport onto elevated solutions such as the presented Elevated Small Group Automated Rapid Transit (ESGART) SkyCabs system, which straddles the gap between Group Rapid Transit (GRT) and Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). This two-way monobeam is detailed, including ease of building through cities and low construction cost. Architectural and engineering aspects of eight-seater cabs, cab frequency, stations, and lines are described. This study also explores connectivity on two example lines in Auckland, New Zealand, within a SkyCabs network and to other modes of transport. Quantitative and qualitative attributes are considered.

848,WOS:000338433600003,"In October 2009 the Greek government realized that the previous governments had been understating their public debt for years. Just two months later Fitch downgraded Greece's debt to BBB+, the lowest credit rating in Europe. The Greek government fries to resolve this historical ""problem"" with a loan from a troika (European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund), which requires the country to implement a wide array of austerity measures, from spending cuts and public sector lay-offs to tax rises and the privatization of public assets. But the three-year crisis has left deep scars on the body of society, leaving thousands out of work and plunging them into poverty. According to the official data from the Greek ELSTAT statistic agency reports, unemployment in Greece hit a new record in October 2012 reaching 26,8 %, compared with 2008, when economic decline started in Greece, unemployment has more than tripled. In addition, according to study by ADEDY and GSEE labor unions, approximately one in two Greeks earns less than 4,871 (sic) a year and lives below the poverty line, defined as the minimum income a family of four needs to eat, dress, use transportation, go to school, and pay the rent. Based on the data from the ministry of environment, energy and climate change the Greek government knows that the greatest problem of the Greek fuels market is fuel smuggling, adulteration and cheating, which lead to distortions in the market. In order to solve this problem the government decides to equalize the price of heating oil with petrol pump prices. However, this decision pushes the price of a litre of heating oil to around 1,3 (sic), about 45 % higher than one year ago. With petrol out of the question for the many, attention has turned to alternative forms of heating. On the other hand, collusion among producers in Greece and a thorough lack of competition that allows a favored few to extract economically unjustified profits have as a result the price of natural gas, wood and pellet to climb. The main goal of this work is to estimate the feasibility of a heat pump system as an alternative solution to the common heating diesel which is used in Greece. Based on the long-term meteorological data from 66 stations, the financial feasibility of a heat pump heating system at each site in Greece was estimated. The RETScreen Clean Energy Project Analysis software was used in order to carry out the feasibility analysis and the green house gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Generally Greece has a typical Mediterranean climate which means hot, dry summers and mild rainy winters with snow mainly at higher elevations. The facts that there aren't areas in Greece which are more than 140 kilometers away from water and nearly 80 % of country is mountainous give varying weather patterns across to the country. According to the heating degree-days, Greece can be divided into 4 climatic zones. Sensitivity analysis was realized for four cities, namely Rhodes, Athens/Filadelpeia, Kavala and Kastoria, which are located in the first, second, third and fourth zone respectively. In accordance with the financial results in the first climatic zone where heating demand is really low, the replacement of heating oil systems with heat pump systems is not very profitable investment. In zone A, based on the results from the RETScreen, the payback period varies between 7-10,5 years, while for the poorest of citizens owing to government subsidy of 0,28(sic)/l the payback period is between 9,8-14,5 years. In the second zone there are several financial benefits from using heat pump system instead of heating oil, the payback period fluctuates from 5,1 up to 6,9 years (without government grant) or from 7,3 up to 9,8 years (with government grant). In the climatic zone C, heat pump system seems provides considerable economic benefits, the relevant results showed that the payback period varies between 4,2-5 or 6-7,1 years without and with government subsidy. In the fourth climatic zone where the climate is similar with that in central Europe, heat pump system is a sound financial investment and the payback period is really short (3,2-4,2 years without government grant or 4,6-6,0 years with government grant). Last but not least, except from financial benefits, there are environmental benefits as well. Based on the RETScreen environmental analysis, the gross annual GHG emissions reduction was estimated to be 1,5 up to 5 tCO(2).","Potolias, C, Potolias, C, Mourmouris, JC, Fantidis, JG, Bandekas, DV, Kourtidis, A",1,Athens,GRC,10.5755/j01.ee.25.2.3442,SRID=4326;POINT (23.71622 37.97945),664046,"Financial Crisis in Greece, Economical Evaluation of Replacement of Heating Diesel Oil with a Heat Pump System",2014

This study aims to investigate the economic, technical and environmental performance of residential PV system running under the Queensland (Australia) climatic conditions, and optimize the size and slope of PV array in the system. The solar irradiation data of the 4 typical climate zones of Queensland, including tropical, sub-tropical, hot arid, and warm temperature zone, are investigated. Using global solar irradiation as solar energy resource data, the price of PV devices, batteries, converters, and grid electricity tariff and sale-back tariff as economic analysis inputs, the system is simulated and optimized by HOMER software. The optimized system not only satisfies the typical residential load of 23 kWh per day but also meets the requirement of minimizing the total costs of system investment and electricity consumption during the system's lifetime. It is found that under the specific climatic conditions of the eleven main cities of Queensland, a PV system is an effective way to decrease electricity bills and mitigate carbon dioxide emission. In particular, a 6 kW PV system in Townsville is able to deal with 61% of the total electricity load and conserves more than 90% of electricity payments and reduce approximately 95% of carbon dioxide emission. It is also found that for all the cities the systems with 20-25 degrees of slope have the best performance including the least cost of energy (COE) and the least carbon dioxide emission.

This paper establishes a carbon balance index (CBI) for an urban ecosystem based on its socio-economic development and land use and land cover change in Xiamen, a rapidly urbanizing coastal city in southeast China. Dynamic changes in CBI can quantitatively indicate the sustainability of the urbanization process from a carbon cycling perspective. Results show that Xiamen's carbon balance condition experienced three stages: the period 1987 - 2002 where CBI decreased slightly, 1992 - 2002 where CBI moderately increased from 1.4 to 4.2, and 2003 - 2011 where CBI rapidly increased from 5.2 to 17.3. The carbon imbalance increased with the expansion of urban scale and urbanization. By stepwise multiple regression analysis, it was found that the main influencing factors of CBI are urbanization rate, industrial coal consumption, length of roadway network and forest area, and city managers should take these factors into consideration to achieve low-carbon city development.

Results suggest that soft policies, integrated with command-and-control measures, and the consideration of bicyclist expectations and concerns with regard to perceptions of safety, speed and comfort have been key in achieving high bicycle trip shares. Integrating these in comprehensive planning frameworks appears to be an approach that is more likely to foster bicycle cultures that can result in urban transport transitions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

863,WOS:000375517900019,"Land use change in the form of urbanization is a direct driver affecting the provision of ecosystem services from forests. To better understand this driver, we modeled the effects of urbanization on three regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in two disparate watersheds in Florida, USA. The study integrated available geospatial and plot-level forest inventory data to assess future changes in carbon storage, timber volume and water yield during a period of 57 years. A 2003-2060 urbanization and land use change scenario was developed using land cover data and a population distribution model. The Integrated Valuation and Ecosystem Services Tradeoffs model was then used to quantify changes in ecosystem services. Carbon storage was reduced by 16% and 26% in the urbanized 2060 scenario in both the rural Lower Suwannee and urban Pensacola Bay watersheds, respectively. Timber volume was reduced by 11% in the Lower Suwannee and 21% in the Pensacola Bay watershed. Water yield, however, increased in both watersheds by 4%. Specific sub-watersheds that were most susceptible to urbanization were identified and mapped and ecosystem service interactions, or trade-offs and synergies, are discussed. Findings reveal how urbanization drives the spatio-temporal dynamics of ecosystem services and their trade-offs. This study provides policy makers and planners an approach to better develop integrated modeling scenarios as well as designing mapping and monitoring protocols for land use change and ecosystem service assessments.

As one of the largest energy consumers, urban residential buildings are required to reduce energy consumption. However nearly all existing urban residential buildings in the Hot Summer and Cold Winter Region of China were built with poor thermal quality. Increasing a building's energy performance has proven to be very helpful in alleviating the pressure of energy shortages and in reducing CO2 emissions. After analyzing the climate of the region, the economic development and existing urban residential buildings of Hangzhou city, one typical building is selected as a case study. Six rational renovation plans, based upon the national and regional standards, are advanced after analyzing their feasibility in simulations and in practice. The energy saving effects of the plans are analyzed using the feedback coefficient method, the reduction of CO2 emissions by a simple LCCO2 method and the costs by a simple LCC method, all for a 40-year residual life span. Based upon these results a suitable plan is developed.

For many megacities such as London and Beijing, the amount of energy that can be stored in the urban local subsurface is greater than their annual heating and cooling demands. The ground source heat pump (GSHP) system - a shallow geothermal technology that provides heating and cooling for buildings by continuously replenishing the energy in the subsurface - has been used increasingly in recent years, but its application has been generally limited to single buildings. In this study, a geographic information system-based simulation model was developed to estimate how many GSHPs could be installed at the city scale without losing control of the ground thermal capacity and to evaluate the degree to which such a system could contribute to the energy demands of buildings in a city. The model was built by embedding a Python-based GSHP design code into ArcGIS software and was trialled on the City of Westminster, a borough in London, UK, as a case study under the two scenarios of boreholes placed under buildings and boreholes around buildings. Under both scenarios, the model produced borehole allocation maps and ratio of capacity to demand maps.

867,WOS:000413791300013,"BACKGROUND: In March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake devastated several power stations and caused severe electricity shortages. This accident was followed by the implementation of policies to reduce summer electricity consumption in the affected areas, for example, by limiting air-conditioning (AC) use. This provided a natural experimental scenario to investigate if these policies were associated with an increase in heat-related mortality. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether the reduced electricity consumption in warm season modified heat-related mortality from 2008 to 2012. METHODS: We conducted prefecture-specific interrupted time-series (ITS) analyses to compare temperature mortality associations before and after the earthquake, and used meta-analysis to generate combined effect estimates for the most affected and less affected areas (prefectures with >10% or <= 10% reductions in electricity consumption, respectively). We then examined whether the temperature mortality association in Tokyo, one of the most affected areas, was modified by the percent reduction in electricity consumption relative to expected consumption for comparable days before the earthquake. RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, we estimated a 5-9% reduction in all-cause heat-related mortality after the earthquake in the 15 prefectures with the greatest reduction in electricity consumption, and little change in the other prefectures. However, the percent reduction in observed vs. expected daily electricity consumption after the earthquake did not significantly modify daily heat-related mortality in Tokyo. CONCLUSIONS: In the prefectures with the greatest reductions in electricity consumption, heat-related mortality decreased rather than increased following the Great East Japan Earthquake. Additional research is needed to determine whether this finding holds for other populations and regions, and to clarify its implications for policies to reduce the consequences of climate change on health.",,0,Tokyo,JPN,10.1289/EHP493,SRID=4326;POINT (139.69171 35.6895),8336599,Heat-Related Mortality in Japan after the 2011 Fukushima Disaster: An Analysis of Potential Influence of Reduced Electricity Consumption,2017

The study also investigates the effects of tourist flows on town's energy consumption by modelling energy scenarios for permanent and summer homes. Two long-term energy scenarios (to 2030) were modelled using the MarIcAL-TIMES generator model: BAU (business as usual), which is the reference scenario, and EHS (exemplary household sector), which involves targets of penetration for renewables and micro-cogeneration. The analysis demonstrated the critical role of end-use energy efficiency in curbing residential consumption. Cogeneration and renewables (PV (photovoltaic) and solar thermal panels) were proven to be valuable solutions to reduce the energetic and environmental burden of the household sector (-20% in 2030). Because most of household energy demand is ascribable to space-heating or hot water production, this study finds that micro-CHP technologies with lower power-to-heat ratios (mainly, Stirling engines and microturbines) show a higher diffusion, as do solar thermal devices. The spread of micro-cogeneration implies a global reduction of primary energy but involves the internalisation of the primary energy, and consequently CO2 emissions, previously consumed in a centralised power plant within the municipality boundaries.

The stages in a fuel chain, for example crude oil recovery, oil refining, or fuel distribution often have significant environmental impacts. Fuel chain analysis is a means of accurately comparing the environmental impacts of alternative energy policy, planning, and investment decisions. A fuel chain analysis was used to compare air emissions from diesel- and compressed-natural-gas- (CNG) fueled buses in Caracas. Because of methane emissions from the existing natural gas recovery and transmission systems in Venezuela, and the lower efficiency of heavy-duty compressed natural gas vehicles in comparison to diesel vehicles, the campressed natural gas fuel chain is not clearly a good choice from the perspective of global warming potential (GWP). However, emissions of local air pollutants, such as particulates, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides, were significantly lower for the CNG fuel chain. The results suggests that a CNG vehicle program may only achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions if it can be associated (either directly or indirectly) with decreases in flaring, venting, and other fugitive emissions fi om the natural gas system, or if the efficiency of heavy duty CNG engines improves in comparison to diesel engines.

These coatings are developed to be used in the urban environment to fight the heat island effect. The spectral reflectance and the infrared emittance were measured and the solar reflectance of the samples was calculated. The surface temperature of the coatings when applied to concrete tiles was monitored, using surface temperature sensors and a data logging system, on 24 h basis from August to December 2005 in an effort to investigate the ability of the cool colored coatings to maintain lower surface temperatures than conventionally pigmented color-matched coatings. The data obtained has been extensively analysed and indicate significant success in the development of these cool colored coatings. It was found that all the coatings containing infrared reflective pigments have solar reflectance values higher than those of standard coatings. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that cool colored coatings maintain lower surface temperatures than color-matched conventionally pigmented coatings. This temperature difference is mainly due to differences in solar reflectance. These cool colored coatings can be used on buildings (roofs and walls) and other surfaces in the urban environment. Thus, at building scale, the use of cool colored coatings with increased solar reflectance can improve building comfort and reduce cooling energy use, and at city city-scale it can contribute to the reduction of the air temperature due to the heat-transfer phenomena and therefore improve outdoor thermal comfort and reduce the heat-island effect.

The predicted value of collector fluid temperature is used as an input in a companion model that, using the second law, predicts the system coefficient of performance (COP) from the known values of condensing temperature, compressor efficiency and refrigerant properties. The combined method presented in this study is ideally suited for preliminary design calculations for a selected location or for comparison of different locations for determination of the energy conservation and carbon emission reduction potential of DX-SAHP hot water systems.

Therefore, in-depth understanding of the impact of industrialization and urbanization processes on CO2 emissions is essential for the achievement of China's CO2 emission reduction targets. In this study, we apply an analysis framework based on input-output analysis and structural decomposition analysis to analyze the CO2 emissions cost of the industrialization and urbanization processes from 1997 to 2012, using the manufacturing center Tianjin as an example. The CO2 emissions of Tianjin tripled during the 15-year studied period. The industrialization process strongly increased CO2 emissions through the rapid growth of the final demand level, while energy intensity improvement played an important role in curbing the rapid emission growth from 1997 to 2012. With respect to specific industries, with a growing share in economic structure, construction was the largest source in the overall CO2 emissions structure. As the pillar industry, transport equipment and information technology (IT) machinery industry were the largest sources in net export-related CO2 emissions, and the IT machinery industry also contributed the most to CO2 emissions growth related to production structure changes. Growing importance of tertiary industry, services (including producer services and consumer services) led to CO2 emissions growth through the growing share in net export and final demand structure during the 2007-2012 period. Besides the influence of industrialization, the rapid urbanization process resulted in a 74.1% growth in household consumption-related CO2 emissions, and the gaps between rural and urban continued to increase. The high demand for city infrastructure and building construction originated from investment also caused a great CO2 emission growth (142.5 Mt, 86.6% CO2 emission growth in Tianjin caused by investment). These results also provide policy implications for curbing the CO2 emissions increase in Tianjin as well as in other cities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The city of Eindhoven (the Netherlands) is used as reference city, for which a scenario is developed in which the assumed future developments adversely influence the maximum peak loads on the network. In this scenario, the total electricity peak load in Eindhoven is expected to increase from 198 MVA in 2009 to 591-633 MVA in 2040.

It is estimated that electrical lighting consumes 25-40% of the total electrical energy in a typical commercial building in the United States. Over the last three decades, there has been a growing concern about reducing energy consumption associated with artificial lightings. Daylighting could be considered as a cost-effective alternative to artificial lighting which not only reduces the demands for electrical energy, but also provides occupants with a pleasant, attractive, and a healthy indoor environment. Through installing sensors and controllers, daylighting is able to reduce and even eliminates the use of artificial lighting needed to deliver sufficient illuminance levels in an office. Present study is a simulation based research that investigates the impacts of various types of daylighting controllers on enhancing total and lighting electrical energy consumption of office buildings located in hot climates. Effects of Dimming (5%, 10%, and 20% light), On/Off, and Stepped control systems are evaluated in this study.

The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The total carbon emissions of Nanjing increased rapidly since 2000, in which the carbon emission from the use of fossil energy was the largest. Meanwhile, carbon sinks of Nanjing presented a declining trend since 2000, which caused the decrease of carbon compensation rate and the increase of urban carbon cycle pressure. (2) The total carbon footprint of Nanjing increased rapidly since 2000, and the carbon deficit was more than ten times of total land areas of Nanjing in 2009, which means Nanjing confronted high carbon cycle pressure. (3) Generally, carbon footprint intensity of Nanjing was on decrease and the carbon footprint productivity was on increase. This indicated that energy utilization rate and carbon efficiency of Nanjing was improved since 2000, and the policy for energy conservation and emission reduction taken by Nanjing's government received better effects. (4) Economic development, population and industrial structure are promoting factors for the increase of carbon footprint of Nanjing, while the industrial carbon footprint intensity was inhibitory factor.

The model is applied to simulate the effect of demand management strategies on reductions in municipal water demands and on the sustained storage in a surface water supply reservoir. Historic and projected climate change hydroclimatic time series are used to assess the effectiveness of domestic water restrictions, including outdoor watering restrictions, a rainwater harvesting rebate program, and a high-density land-use change policy.

The framework provides an approach to evaluate a combination of multiple strategies for effectively managing the increasing stresses caused by urbanization, population growth, and climate change. Results demonstrate that adaptive demand management strategies that respond to water shortages result in long-term per capita demand reductions. For climate projections that forecast severe water shortages, development density strategies are more effective than rainwater harvesting strategies, and a combination of strategies can reduce the need for interbasin transfers and maintain reservoir volumes.

881,WOS:000409290700063,"Cities around the world have launched greening initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint and to become more sustainable. At the same time, they have also sought to use these initiatives to position themselves as climate change leaders and green champions. This paper focuses on the City of Vancouver's Greenest City 2020 Action Plan as urban policy strategy to reduce carbon emissions. Based on interviews with actors and experts involved in the development and implementation of the plan, the paper evaluates the role green leadership aspirations play in shaping urban climate change policy and how policy makers and stakeholders use policy to position the city and its greening initiatives locally and globally. In particular, it analyzes the role of competitive positioning and green leadership in sustain ability initiatives and change within and beyond urban boundaries. While leadership suggests increased buy-in of residents and those involved in the implementation of the strategy and multiplication effects through learning within the region and between (peer) cities, it can also pose challenges as the interest in meeting leadership claims can impede more radical change through specific targets and implementation strategies and challenge other sustainability objectives.

Meteorological inputs to the CMAQ chemical transport model are developed by downscaling the GISS Global Climate Model simulations using an MM5-based regional climate model. Future-year emissions for North America are developed by growing the U. S. EPA CAIR inventory, Mexican and Canadian emissions and by using the IMAGE model with the IPCC A1B emissions scenario that is also used in projecting future climate. Reductions of more than 50% in NOX and SO2 emissions are forecast. Impacts of global climate change alone on regional air quality are small compared to impacts from emission control-related reductions, although increases in pollutant concentrations due to stagnation and other factors are found. The combined effect of climate change and emission reductions lead to a 20% decrease (regionally varying from -11% to -28%) in the mean summer maximum daily 8-hour ozone levels (M8hO(3)) over the United States. Mean annual PM2.5 concentrations are estimated to be 23% lower (varies from -9% to -32%). Major reductions in sulfate, nitrate and ammonium PM2.5 components combined with the limited reduction in organic carbon suggests that organic carbon will be the dominant component of PM2.5 mass in the future. Regionally, the eastern United States benefits more than the rest of the regions from reductions in both M8hO(3) and PM2.5, because of both spatial variations in the meteorological and emissions changes. Reduction in the higher M8hO(3) concentrations is also estimated for all subregions and fewer days with M8hO(3) above the air quality standards in urban sites with Atlanta in the southeast benefiting most.","Tagaris, E, Manomaiphiboon, K, Liao, KJ, Leung, LR, Woo, JH, He, S, Amar, P, Russell, AG",115,Atlanta,USA,10.1029/2006JD008262,SRID=4326;POINT (-84.38798 33.749),463878,Impacts of global climate change and emissions on regional ozone and fine particulate matter concentrations over the United States,2007

Therefore, optimization of the urban industrial structure is urgently required to pursue the low-carbon goal under the constraints of water supply. In this paper, we chose Dalian city in China as a case study and divided its industrial sectors into three types according to their output value. Meanwhile, we used the LMDI (Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index) method to decompose the factors that impact industrial carbon emissions from energy consumption. Based on the ratio of the carbon emission effects, five scenarios were set respectively, and accounted for the carbon emissions and water consumption under different scenarios of industrial structure. The results indicated that the economic growth effect was the most significant factor that contributed to industrial carbon emissions, while industrial structure effect was the largest negative factor for increasing industrial carbon emissions. The results also indicated that the total carbon emissions under the HOV (high output-value)-preferred and water-conserved scenario will be lower by 8.5% in 2020 than the baseline scenario, while both its energy intensity and water intensity will meet the requirements of the constraints of the urban development planning.

Hence, China has launched a pilot low-carbon city program to explore low-carbon pathways since 2010. This study employed a Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System model (LEAP) to simulate six energy sectors-related GHG emissions in a pilot low-carbon Ningbo city, China. The LEAP-Ningbo model comprises three basic modules, i.e. energy supply, energy transformation and end-use energy demand in six urban sectors (i.e., household, service, agriculture, transport, industry, and transformation sectors), and resulting environmental impacts (CO2 equivalents). The results identified by the business as usual (BAU) scenario indicate that total energy consumption is expected to reach 449.72 Mtce and results in emissions of 651.83 Mt CO2, by 2050. In contrast, more aggressive policies and strategies involved in the integrated scenario (INT), which combines the energy structure optimization (ESO) scenario with the policy-oriented energy saving (PES) scenario, can lower energy demand by 14% and CO2e emissions by 27%. A comparison among global cities and low-carbon plans helps identify the carbon emission level and define the actionable low-carbon policies. The high correlation between sectoral energy use and resulting GHG emissions implies energy-carbon reduction efforts,e.g., low-carbon energy substitution, intensive energy-saving policies, the improvement of energy efficiency, and industrial transformation. Achieving low-carbon city targets requires timeline-restricted actions and backgrounds-based measures in plans.

Also the compatibility of meteorological parameters in NC with the safety operating conditions of PV modules is determined. In addition, two different solar panel mounting systems, fixed panels with 35 degrees and two axis solar tracking system, are compared. The project viability analysis is performed using RETScreen version 4.0 software through electric energy production analysis, financial analysis, and green house gas (GHG) emission analysis. It is found that all of the sites considered through this study are feasible for a 1 MW solar PV power plant investment. However, Morphou offers highest profitability, energy production and GHG emission reduction. On the other hand, it is also observed that economical and environmental feasibility of these investments increases if two axis tracking system is used rather than mounting solar collectors on a fixed structure.

888,WOS:000395014400003,"Cycling is a healthy, low-cost, and low-carbon alternative to motorized transport. As a relatively fast active mode of transport, cycling can overcome the distance barrier of walking, while also providing cardiovascular exercise and reducing demand for motor vehicle travel. The cycling renaissance has seen an increase in the number of cyclists in urban spaces, and there is evidence of increased investment in cycling infrastructure and cycle skills training in some places. Yet the number of high school students cycling to school is declining in many industrialized countries. Transport to school is a major contributor to daily traffic congestion, resulting in both local and global environmental concerns, and high school students have been relatively overlooked in research to date. In this paper, we present empirical material from a qualitative study of high school students and parents in Dunedin, Aotearoa New Zealand. Focus group sessions were conducted during 2014 and 2015 with students and parents separately, to explore their perceptions of modes of transport and transport to school decision making. Key findings relate to perceived safety, implicit messages, and social norms. We find that a complex range of factors contribute to perceptions of cycling safety, including features and perceptions of the built environment, traffic safety (including behaviors of other road users), previous cycling experiences (including accidents), and adolescents' cycling skills and on-road experiences. Overcoming concerns through behavioral and cultural interventions coupled with upskilling and thoughtful infrastructure may present a pathway to increasing rates of cycling.","Hopkins, D, Mandic, S",2,Dunedin,NZL,10.1080/15568318.2016.1253803,SRID=4326;POINT (170.50361 -45.87416),114347,Perceptions of cycling among high school students and their parents,2017

The factors influencing the emissions of individuals are largely undocumented, but they are assumed to be the same for all, be they low or high emitters. We use a household travel survey conducted in the metropolitan area of Barcelona to differentiate the factors that result in different rates of emission. It shows that the top 10% of emitters produce 49% of total emissions while 'non-daily' emitters make up 38.5% of the sample. We adopt a quantile regression approach, which reveals significant socioeconomic differences between groups of emitters. Gender, income and home-municipality type are influential in accounting for CO2 emissions for all groups. Educational level appears to be less significant, and occupation shows no significance at all. The study confirms the ineffective nature of toll policy design in the area. Overall, socioeconomic factors have different impacts on different emitting groups, but these characteristics do not impact equally across all the population.

In this study, an experimental investigation at the micro-scale and also a numerical simulation at the macro-scale of a typical urban environment in Adelaide were conducted to estimate the potential for mitigating the UHI effect. The results showed that existing low albedo materials such as asphalt, metal roofs and brick pavements contribute to the heat island potential. Also, urban development and a lack of natural vegetation contribute to increased temperatures in cities. The ability of two types of extensive and intensive green roofs to reduce the surrounding micro-climate temperature were monitored. The results showed that they have significant cooling effects in summer time and could behave as an insulation layer to keep buildings warmer in the winter. Furthermore, different scenarios of adding green roofs to the Adelaide urban environment were investigated using the Envi-MET model. The scenario modelling of adding green roofs in a typical urban area in Adelaide, Australia, supported the hypothesis that this can lead to reductions in energy consumption in the Adelaide urban environment. Also an increased use of other water sensitive urban design technologies such as green walls and street trees together with the adoption of high albedo materials is recommended for achieving the optimum efficiency in terms of reducing urban temperatures and mitigating urban heat island effects.

891,WOS:000329377600047,"CO2 emissions on roads in urban centers substantially affect global warming. It is important to quantify CO2 emissions in terms of the link unit in order to reduce these emissions on the roads. Therefore, in this study, we utilized real-time traffic data and attempted to develop a methodology for estimating CO2 emissions per link unit. Because of the recent development of the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication technology, data from probe vehicles (PVs) can be collected and speed per link unit can be calculated. Among the existing emission calculation methodologies, mesoscale modeling, which is a representative modeling measurement technique, requires speed and traffic data per link unit. As it is not feasible to install fixed detectors at every link for traffic data collection, in this study, we developed a model for traffic volume estimation by utilizing the number of PVs that can be additionally collected when the PV data are collected. Multiple linear regression and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used for estimating the traffic volume. The independent variables and input data for each model are the number of PVs, travel time index mu the number of lanes, and time slots. The result from the traffic volume estimate model shows that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the ANN is 18.67%, thus proving that it is more effective. The ANN-based traffic volume estimation served as the basis for the calculation of emissions per link unit. The daily average emissions for Daejeon, where this study was based, were 2210.19 ton/day. By vehicle type, passenger cars accounted for 71.28% of the total emissions. By road, Gyeryongro emitted 125.48 ton/day, accounting for 5.68% of the total emission, the highest percentage of all roads. In terms of emissions per kilometer, Hanbatdaero had the highest emission volume, with 7.26 ton/day/km on average. This study proves that real-time traffic data allow an emissions estimate in terms of the link unit. Furthermore, an analysis of CO2 emissions can support traffic management to make decisions related to the reduction of carbon emissions. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

And, what might be the cause of lacking institutional entrepreneurship?In this article, the latter question is examined through in-depth collaborative research project for exploring alternative, adaptive flood risk strategies for flood proofing the unembanked area of the north-end of the city district Feijenoord in Rotterdam. Due to climate change, these areas are increasingly vulnerable to flooding. The traditional, institutionalized solution of raising the ground level before initiating new spatial developments does not suffice in the long term. Therefore, the city government explored alternative strategies for more adaptive ways of dealing with flood risks. Together with representatives of key stakeholders in the area, two key strategies for the unembanked areas were elaborated. These strategies have significant implications for the distribution of costs, risks and responsibilities and necessitate alternative governance architectures that exceed the current institutional structures.During the research project, it became clear that the developed alternative strategies fundamentally differed from the current institutional system. Thus, institutional redesign was necessary. This proved to be virtually impossible, especially because none of the involved actors was willing nor capable of undertaking entrepreneurial activities to start such redesign.

Further aim is to use these results for better design of green structures. The microclimate measurements were carried out in real scale structures (hydroponic pergola and hydroponic green wall) at the Kostakii Campus of the Technological Education Institute of Epirus (Arta, Greece).

The model was used to predict the effects of green structures on air temperature (T-air), relative humidity (RH), and mean radiant temperature (T-mrt). The output values of these parameters were used as input data in the RayMan pro (V 2.1) model for estimating the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) of different case scenarios. The average daytime value of simulated air temperature in the atrium for the case without and with pergola during three different days was 29.2 and 28.9 A degrees C while the corresponding measured values were 29.7 and 29.2 A degrees C. The results showed that compared to the case with no pergola in the atrium, covering 100% the atrium area with a planted pergola reduced at the hottest part of the day T-mrt and PET values by 29.4 and 17.9 A degrees C, respectively. Although the values of air temperature (measured and simulated) were not greatly affected by the presence of a green wall, the most important effect of green wall to the building wall is the reduction of solar radiation behind the green wall. This reduction leads to a significant reduction (about 8 A degrees C) of building surface temperature behind the green wall and accordingly to a reduction of the energy load of the building.","Katsoulas, N, Antoniadis, D, Tsirogiannis, IL, Labraki, E, Bartzanas, T, Kittas, C",0,Man,CIV,10.1007/s00484-016-1274-0,SRID=4326;POINT (-7.55383 7.41251),139341,Microclimatic effects of planted hydroponic structures in urban environment: measurements and simulations,2017

In particular, activities of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP), pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were measured and lipid peroxidation was assessed by malondialdehyde (MDA) quantification. In addition, a condition index was calculated to assess the overall health of the mussels. Moderate PAH contamination was detected in digestive glands of both native and caged individuals from the exposed site. Modulations of biomarkers were detected in digestive glands of native harbor mussels indicating the presence of a chemical pressure. In particular, results suggested increased biotransformation (GST), antioxidant defenses (CAT), NADPH generation (IDP) and gluconeogenesis (PEPCK), which could represent a coordinated response against chemically-induced cellular stress. Lipid peroxidation assessment and condition index indicated an absence of acute stress in the same mussels suggesting metabolic changes could, at least partially, offset the negative effects of contamination. In caged mussels, only GR was found modulated compared to non-exposed mussels but significant differences in oxidative stress and energy-related biomarkers were observed compared to native harbor mussels. Overall, these results suggested mussels chronically exposed to contamination have set up metabolic adaptation, which may contribute to their survival in the moderately contaminated harbor of Brest. Whether these adaptive traits result from phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation needs to be further investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

899,WOS:000389090300013,"Household carbon emissions from energy use are rapidly increasing in conjunction with growing urbanization; their reduction is critical for local urban climate improvement and the sustainable development of cities. Low-carbon behavior is proved as a key element determining residents' lifestyle. Understanding how that behavior affects household energy use will be useful in promoting low-carbon households. In this study, Xiamen, a coastal city was divided into areas at high and low risk of flooding. We used the path analysis method-integrated with behavior and socioeconomic factors to explore the mechanisms of low carbon behavior effects on household direct energy use and related carbon emissions. We found that socioeconomic conditions combined with low-carbon behavior had direct and indirect impacts on household carbon emissions. Low-carbon behavior in the high-risk area contributed most to reducing carbon emissions. Education level was the important factors in the low-risk area. Government-led policies encouraging low-carbon behavior were effective in reducing household carbon emissions in the high-risk area. However, in low-risk areas, education about a low-carbon lifestyle is an effective means for reducing carbon emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was the first initiative to develop a complete and transparent GHG inventory of Beijing, to document the current situation and to help governmental officials to clarify their priorities for reducing GHG emissions. The authors investigated and calculated the emission sources defined by the GPC, and assessed data accuracy. The contents of the detailed inventory were documented and are open for research verification and for methodological references for other cities. The results showed that three emission sources, i.e. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from industrial production and CH4 emissions from landfills, contributed 97% of Beijing's GHGs. Considering the problem of missing data and low data quality, the authors suggested that instead of seeking to compile a complete inventory, Chinese cities should first report their GHG emissions from these sources, while improving the data quality for the long run. The authors anticipate that the findings reported in this paper will help to strengthen city-level GHG inventory research in China and throughout the world. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

901,WOS:000414578400018,"This study has investigated the feasibility of three different solar-assisted air conditioning systems for typical medium-sized office buildings in all eight Australian capital cities using the whole building energy simulation software EnergyPlus. The studied solar cooling systems include: solar desiccant-evaporative cooling (SDEC) system, hybrid solar desiccant-compression cooling (SDCC) system, and solar absorption cooling (SAC) system. A referenced conventional vapor compression variable-air-volume (VAV) system has also been investigated for comparison purpose. The technical, environmental, and economic performances of each solar cooling system have been evaluated in terms of solar fraction (SF), system coefficient of performance (COP), annual HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) electricity consumption, annual CO2 emissions reduction, payback period (PBP), and net present value (NPV). The results demonstrate that the SDEC system consumes the least energy in Brisbane and Darwin, achieving 56.9% and 82.1% annual energy savings, respectively, compared to the conventional VAV system, while for the other six cities, the SAC system is the most energy efficient. However, from both energy and economic aspects, the SDEC system is more feasible in Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney because of high annual SF and COP, low yearly energy consumption, short PBP and positive NPV, while for Canberra and Hobart, although the SAC system achieves considerable energy savings, it is not economically beneficial due to high initial cost. Therefore, the SDEC system is the most economically beneficial for most of Australian cities, especially in hot and humid climates. The SAC system is also energy efficient, but is not as economic as the SDEC system. However, for Canberra and Hobart, reducing initial cost is the key point to achieve economic feasibility of solar cooling applications.",,1,Darwin; Perth; Brisbane; Sydney; Canberra; Hobart; Adelaide; Melbourne,AUS; AUS; AUS; AUS; AUS; AUS; AUS; AUS,10.3390/en10101463,SRID=4326;POINT (130.84185 -12.46113); SRID=4326;POINT (115.8614 -31.95224); SRID=4326;POINT (153.02809 -27.46794); SRID=4326;POINT (151.20732 -33.86785); SRID=4326;POINT (149.12807 -35.28346); SRID=4326;POINT (147.32941 -42.87936); SRID=4326;POINT (138.59863 -34.92866); SRID=4326;POINT (144.96332 -37.814),129062; 1896548; 2189878; 4627345; 367752; 216656; 1225235; 4246375,Comparison of Different Solar-Assisted Air Conditioning Systems for Australian Office Buildings,2017

Firstly, six objective functions, namely, cost minimization, GHG minimization, eco-efficiency minimization, cost maximization, GHG maximization and eco-efficiency maximization, are built and subjected to the same constraints with each objective function corresponding to one scenario. Secondly, GHG emissions and costs are derived from the waste flow of each scenario. Thirdly, the range of GHG emissions and costs of other potential scenarios are obtained and plotted through adjusting waste flow with infinitely possible step sizes according to the correlation among the above six scenarios. And the optimal scenario is determined based on this range. The results suggest the following conclusions. 1) The scenarios located on the border between scenario cost minimization and GHG minimization create an optimum curve, and scenario GHG minimization has the smallest eco-efficiency on the curve; 2) Simple pursuit of eco-efficiency minimization using fractional programming may be unreasonable; 3) Balancing GHG emissions from incineration and landfills benefits Tianjin's waste management system as it reduces GHG emissions and costs.","Deng, N, Zhang, Q, Chen, GW, Qi, CQ, Cui, WQ, Zhang, YF, Ma, HT",1,Tianjin,CHN,10.1007/s11771-015-2598-3,SRID=4326;POINT (117.17667 39.14222),11090314,Optimal scenario balance of reduction in costs and greenhouse gas emissions for municipal solid waste management,2015

From 2007 to 2009, the total quantity of GHG emissions from livestock sector in Beijing was 1.67 Tg CO(2)e yr(-1), of which N2O-N and CH4 emissions were 1.04 Gg yr(-1) (489 Gg CO(2)e yr(-1)) and 47.25 Gg yr(-1) (1181.25 Gg CO(2)e yr(-1)), respectively. The emission intensity per 10,000 RMB was 1.2 Mg CO(2)e, which accounted for 63% of the averaged value of 1.9 Mg CO(2)e in Beijing. Consequently, Beijing's modern urban agriculture has made progress to some extent. To reduce GHG emissions from the livestock sector, relevant strategies such as improving rearing technologies, breeding, strengthening management and developing large-scale biogas industry should be considered. Theoretical, biogas industry could offset about 80% of GHG emissions from livestock sector, yet there are some barriers, which need to be overcome to enhance cooperation among government agencies, market organizations and livestock enterprises. Furthermore, it is both essential and feasible to adopt a healthy lifestyle, clean cooking, and low-C food systems to mitigate and reduce GHG emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

904,WOS:000402217100014,"Exports of woody pellets from the southeastern United States (US) for European power plants have expanded since 2009, leading to concerns about major negative environmental effects. US exports of wood pellets have grown from essentially nothing in 2008 to 4.6 million metric tons in 2015, with 99% of US pellets being shipped to Europe. To examine effects of this recent expansion of the pellet industry on forest conditions, we use US Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) annual survey data for 2002-2014 to analyze changes in timberland trends since 2009 for two fuelsheds supplying pellets to the ports of Chesapeake, Virginia, and Savannah, Georgia. This analysis reveals that the Chesapeake fuelshed had significant increases in acreage of large trees and harvestable carbon after 2009. Furthermore, the timberland volume within plantations increased in the Chesapeake fuelshed after 2009. The Savannah fuelshed had significant increases in volume, areas with large trees, and all carbon pools after 2008. Increases in carbon in live trees for the Chesapeake fuelshed and all carbon pools for the Savannah fuelshed for the years before and after 2009 provide empirical support to prior estimates that production of wood-based pellets in the southeast US can enhance greenhouse gas sequestration. Both fuelsheds retained more naturally regenerating stands than plantations; however the number of standing dead trees increased within naturally regenerating stands and declined within plantations (but only significantly for the Savannah fuelshed). While the decrease in the number of standing dead trees per hectare for the Savannah fuelshed plantations after 2009 warrants investigation into its effects on biodiversity, others have recommended thinning and hardwood mid-story control within pine plantations to provide habitat for regionally declining bird species, which is consistent with use of biomass for energy and reducing the risk of fire. While all energy use affects the environment, these results show that benefits accrue when sustainable forest management provides wood pellets for energy that keep fossil fuel in the ground. By contrast urbanization is the greatest cause of forest loss in the SE US. It is essential to consistently monitor and assess forest conditions to assess changes, for exports of wood-based pellets for the southern US are expected to grow. Even though use of pellets for energy has more than doubled, the pellet industry constitutes < 1% of US forest products by weight. Therefore, any recent changes, in SE US forest conditions are more likely related to the 2008 declines in the housing market. Continued analysis of annual FIA data using the methods outlined in this manuscript provides a scientifically valid approach for ongoing assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The ultimate aim of such work is obtaining datasets useful to support, in a GIS environment, the decision makers in developing adequate strategies to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission. In the processing proposed, the computing of radiometric quantities related to the atmosphere was performed by the Modtran 5 radiative transfer code, while an object-oriented supervised classification was applied on a WorldView-2 multispectral image, together with a high-resolution digital surface model (DSM), to distinguish among the major roofing material types and to model the effects of the emissivity. The emissivity values were derived from literature data, except for some roofing materials, which were measured during ad hoc surveys, by means of a thermal camera and a contact probe.

The core contribution of this paper is the assessment of the system's two modes of operations (independent versus coordinated) under different congestion levels and network configurations. The insights and conclusions of the paper are based on the synergetic effect of the following: (1) appropriate design of the adaptive system parameters, (2) seamless design of generic interfaces between the adaptive system and the simulation environment using application programming interfaces, (3) rigorously calibrated simulation model and a comprehensive set of performance and environmental measures, and (4) investigation of the system components required for building a complete functioning system in the field. The system was designed and lab-tested on two case studies in the City of Burlington, Ontario. The intersections were designed and operated using the adaptive system and compared to the actuated optimized and coordinated base case timings plans. The analysis of the simulation results shows that overall the adaptive system outperforms the base case scenario by up to 25% savings in delay at the network level, and 15% reduction in CO2 emission. On the other hand, the results of the two testbed models indicate that the performance of the adaptive system varies according to the intersection conditions and flows, network configuration, traffic volume, variability in flow arrivals, and the proximity of intersections to each other.","Abdelgawad, H, Abdulhai, B, El-Tantawy, S, Hadayeghi, A, Zvaniga, B",0,Burlington; Ontario,USA; USA,10.1139/cjce-2014-0503,SRID=4326;POINT (-79.4378 36.09569); SRID=4326;POINT (-117.65089 34.06334),52472; 171214,Assessment of self-learning adaptive traffic signal control on congested urban areas: independent versus coordinated perspectives,2015
907,WOS:000236527600013,"Our objective is to establish the link between energy consumption and technologies, air pollution concentrations, and resulting impacts on public health in eastern China. We use Zaozhuang, a city in eastern China heavily dependent on coal, as a case study to quantify the impacts that air pollution in eastern China had on public health in 2000 and the benefits in improved air quality and health that could be obtained by 2020, relative to business-as-usual (BAU), through the implementation of best available emission control technology (BACT) and advanced coal gasification technologies (ACGT). We use an integrated assessment approach, utilizing state-of-the-science air quality and meteorological models, engineering, epidemiology, and economics, to achieve this objective. We find that total health damages due to year 2000 anthropogenic emissions from Zaozhuang, using the ""willingness-to-pay"" metric, was equivalent to 10% of Zaozhuang's GDP. If all health damages resulting from coal use were internalized in the market price of coal, the year 2000 price would have more than tripled. With no new air pollution controls implemented between 2000 and 2020 but with projected increases in energy use, we estimate health damages from air pollution exposure to be equivalent to 16% of Zaozhuang's projected 2020 GDP. BACT and ACGT (with only 24% penetration in Zaozhuang and providing 2% of energy needs in three surrounding municipalities) could reduce the potential health damage of air pollution in 2020 to 13% and 8% of projected GDP, respectively. Benefits to public health, of substantial monetary value, can be achieved through the use of BACT; health benefits from the use of ACGT could be even larger. Despite significant uncertainty associated with each element of the integrated assessment approach, we demonstrate that substantial benefits to public health could be achieved in this region of eastern China through the use of additional pollution controls and particularly from the use of advanced coal gasification technology.

Separated by a distance of 96 km, both cities have a sustained development and are climatically similar, since they present numerous sunny days, extreme hot temperatures and little precipitation. The results presented show differences in their behavior and in the solar radiation measurement values, especially for the critical spring and summer seasons, with values 15.73% (0.042 kW/m(2)) higher in Mexicali with respect to Yuma. Energy power is estimated, and it is discussed with some variables as global solar radiation, rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity and climatology of clear, partly cloudy, and cloudy days. With this estimation, the solar energy used and GHG avoided is projected for Mexicali. It is assessed that 291 tons of GHG are prevented. The Mexicali values of potential energy are higher than those of Yuma; therefore, this solar and energy comparative study provides reasons to develop these technologies in Mexico, but solar technologies should be deployed also in Yuma.

Yet while there has been a wide survey of global initiatives and attempts to explain the wider processes driving such experimentation (Bulkeley and Castan Broto, 2013) there remains a lack of empirical case study analysis to bring the concepts into context. In this paper we use the concept of urban experimentation as a lens to discuss the political and social ramifications of one such intervention in a city's energy infrastructure network, with an examination of the Pecan Street smart grid project in Austin, Texas. The ability for cities to manage socio-technical transitions and their inflections by specific locales has been largely neglected in social science research, yet cities around the world are facing similar problems of ageing infrastructures, pressures of resource consumption and demanding shifts towards intermittent renewable technologies. We argue that cities are key arenas for the trialling, testing and development of smart products that can help transition towards a low-carbon economy, however the opening up' of cities as experimental nodes is contributing to a restructuring in socio-technical urban governance, creating new spaces for private investment while delegating responsibilities for carbon control down to urban citizens.","McLean, A, Bulkeley, H, Crang, M",4,Austin,USA,10.1177/0042098015612984,SRID=4326;POINT (-97.74306 30.26715),931830,Negotiating the urban smart grid: Socio-technical experimentation in the city of Austin,2016

In this research, Guangyuan, a mountainous city located in southwestern China, which was heavily affected by the 2008 earthquake, was used as a studying case. In this city, gridded data of vertical carbon flows at 1-km resolution was extracted based on point emission sources and other supporting data in Guangyuan. Among the 16,020 grids, 4,465 performed as CO2 emission sources while the other 11,555 as sinks. On the whole, Guangyuan City served as a carbon sink in 2010, with the total net flow of 0.44 Mt CO2 being sequestered and stored by vegetations. The overall pattern of emission sources and sinks matched well with local land-use patterns. The hotspots of CO2 emissions appeared in the built-up areas along local valleys, as well as low mountainous areas. On the contrary, large areas of carbon sinks were mainly distributed in the mountainous areas of northwest and northeast parts of Guangyuan. With regard to the distribution of gridded emissions, an evidently clustered characteristic was identified. The proportion of the largest individual emission grid accounted for 12.01% of the total emission.

915,WOS:000298407400012,"The establishment of low-carbon cities has been suggested all over the World, since cities are key drivers of energy usage and the associated carbon emissions. This paper presents a scenario analysis of future energy consumption and carbon emissions for the city of Beijing. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model is used to simulate a range of pathways and to analyze how these would change energy consumption and carbon emissions from 2007 to 2030. Three scenarios have been designed to describe future energy strategies in relation to the development of Beijing city, namely a reference scenario (RS), control scenario (CS), and integrated scenario (IS). The results show that under the IS the total energy demand in Beijing is expected to reach 88.61 million tonnes coal equivalent (Mtce) by 2030 (59.32 Mtce in 2007), 55.82% and 32.72% lower than the values under the RS and the CS, respectively. The total carbon emissions in 2030 under the IS, although higher than the 2007 level, will be 62.22% and 40.27% lower than under the RS and the CS, respectively, with emissions peaking in 2026 and declining afterwards. In terms of the potential for reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions, the industrial sector will continue to act as the largest contributor under the IS and CS compared with the RS, while the building and transport sectors are identified as promising fields for achieving effective control of energy consumption and carbon emissions over the next two decades. The calculation results show that an integrated package of measures is the most effective in terms of energy savings and carbon emissions mitigation, although it also faces the largest challenge to achieve the related targets.","Zhang, LX, Feng, YY, Chen, B",34,Beijing,CHN,10.3390/en4122295,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,"Alternative Scenarios for the Development of a Low-Carbon City: A Case Study of Beijing, China",2011

Nevertheless, few studies have explored the application of orthogonal experimental design (OED) method to optimize building design for the lowest carbon emissions of building operational energy consumption. This paper aims at developing a new optimization method to building envelope design for the lowest carbon emissions of building operational energy consumption using OED. Firstly, according to the basic principles of the building heat transfer, the method of building's energy consumption calculation is analyzed, which includes the simplified algorithm based on steady-state heat transfer theory and the dynamic simulation based on the unsteady heat transfer theory. The classification of the building energy consumption influencing factors are then investigated and discussed. Furthermore, based on the basic concept and principle of OED, a case study from the perspective of OED has been conducted, which involves a public building in Nantong, Jiangsu province. Six influence factors of building envelope to building operational energy consumption are selected as follows: exterior wall type, window frame type, glass type, roof type, floor type, and shading type. Selection of optimal case is then determined by the index that is based on the year-round accumulative total load. In the end, Tianzheng Building Energy Consumption Software is used to calculate the optimal case operational energy consumption. The research would provide a new optimization method for building envelope design to the lowest carbon emissions of building operational energy consumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Partnerships offer the opportunity to link the actions of diverse actors operating at different scales and, thus, they may be flexible enough to deal with uncertain futures and changing development demands. However, simultaneously, partnerships may lack effectiveness in delivering action at the local level, and may constitute a strategy for some actors to legitimate their objectives in spite of the interests of other partners. Engaging with the specific example of urban governance in Maputo, Mozambique, the authors present an analysis of potential partnerships in this context, in relation to the actors that are willing and able to intervene to deliver climate change action. What, they ask, are the challenges to achieving common objectives in partnerships from the perspective of local residents in informal settlements? The analysis describes a changing context of climate change governance in the city, in which the prospects of access to international finance for climate change adaptation are moving institutional actors towards engaging with participatory processes at the local level. However, the analysis suggests a question about the extent to which local communities are actually perceived as actors with legitimate interests who can intervene in partnerships, and whether their interests are recognised.","Broto, VC, Macucule, DA, Boyd, E, Ensor, J, Allen, C",4,Maputo,MOZ,10.1068/a140070p,SRID=4326;POINT (32.58322 -25.96553),1191613,"Building collaborative partnerships for climate change action in Maputo, Mozambique",2015

The main question of this paper is: How can Shanghai continue its economic growth, while controlling the negative consequences of its energy use and production in a responsible way? For the approach, it explores the use of the C40 framework, as an application and specification of new synergy seeking approaches, such as Value Sensitive Design. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is a global city-level network to address climate change and promote world-class projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a quantitative analysis of Shanghai's energy trends is made as well as a SWOT analysis to map and evaluate its current environmental, social, economic and political characteristics. Three main challenges are presented, related to institutional inclusiveness, global relations, and long-term innovation. In view of the initiatives, targets, and the whole network of the C40 movement, this paper concludes that Shanghai is strongly recommended to fully use the C40 framework in creating a sustainable and responsible future.

While studies on corporate sustainability are numerous, there is little, if any, existing research that examines the role of companies in climate change adaptation and mitigation within specific urban areas. Urban ecologists also have not examined how corporate activity affects urban systems. Taking a multi-disciplinary systems approach, we present a conceptual model of the role of companies in managing urban interactions with the climate system.

Road transport bears 73% share of total CO2 emissions from transport sector. High concentration of these gases leads to air pollution in terms of poor air quality and health related risks. Many countries have adopted carbon tax as a cost effective measure to correct environmental externality and reduce CO2 emissions since early 1990s. But before adopting carbon tax as a policy measure, it is important to determine people's willingness to pay (WTP) for effective implementation of the same. In order to know the effectiveness of carbon tax in Indian road passenger transport, this study presents the contingent valuation analysis of people's willingness to pay with the help of primary data collected from three different metropolitan cities - Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. Probit and tobit regression models are used to analyse the data. Fihdings show that people of India are willing to pay. Environmental awareness in terms of people's interest in environment, their environmental activities, education, income and age have significant role in determining WTP.

Bringing infrastructure networks into view as a central tenet to the governing of climate change is not simply a matter of recognizing such spheres as critical sites for urban climate policy, but rather requires a conceptual approach that moves beyond a concern with the capacities of individual actors and institutions, and engages with the ways in which power operates and is constituted through the socio-materiality of the city. Drawing on theories of governmentality we develop such an approach and use it to examine the ways in which housing is providing a means through which experimentation with climate governance is taking place in Cape Town and Sao Paulo. Through this analysis we find that climate change is being mobilized both as a means to create new flows of carbon finance and as a means through which to advance calls for social inclusion and 'dignified' housing. Rather than being characterized by one dominant model, we suggest that the governing of climate change in cities in the global South is multiple, combining market and social logics in eclectic ways, where one is not predominant and both are in constant negotiation, dialogue and contestation.

Urban agriculture is of great interest because of its potential in reducing the indirect CO2 emissions of a city's food supply by reducing transportation distances, the packaging required and the food losses that occur during transportation. However, intensive urban agriculture production, which often relies on the use of soilless substrates, requires synthetic fertilizers rich in nitrogen, resulting in N2O emissions. Presently, there is a lack of studies that determine the generation of N2O from soilless crops to properly account for their global warming potential. In this study, an open chamber system was used to quantify N2O emissions from lettuce crops with perlite bags as their substrate in a Mediterranean rooftop greenhouse located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain). N2O generation, through nitrifying and denitrifying reactions, was limited by assuring an aerobic environment, negligible water retention, the absence of NH3, and controlled dosage of NO3- in the most favorable pH conditions for plant assimilation. The emission factor (EF) measured for the soilless lettuce crop (0.0072-0.0085 kg N2O-1 per kg N-1) was half the EF of the IPCC method (0.0125 kg N2O-1 per kg N-1) for soil crops, which is commonly used in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to approximate direct N2O emissions, for lack of a better method. Using a more appropriate EF for an LCA study of a tomato crop grown under similar conditions to those used to generate the EF resulted in a 7.5% reduction (0.06 kg CO2 eq. per kilogram of tomato production) in total global warming potential. This study shows that soilless crops reduce N2O emissions when compared to conventional crops, making urban agriculture an attractive practice for reducing GHG emissions. The results highlight the need to determine a standard method for determining an EF applicable to soilless protected crops, which, based on the parameters described here, such as the type of substrate, fertilizers and irrigation system, would allow for a more accurate environmental evaluation of soilless conventional and urban crops.

In the model, 18 sub-indicators of environmental performance from energy use planning are classified into four categories: structure of energy use and industry, technology and efficiency of energy use, environmental impacts caused by energy use, and the socio-economic benefits of energy use. Membership degree analysis is applied to each indicator. Three energy use scenarios which are, respectively, environment-friendly, technology-led, and economic policy-led are evaluated. The results show that the technology-led energy use planning is best. The sustainable energy use policies are proposed from three aspects, including optimizing the energy use and industrial structure, encouraging development of energy-saving and air pollution control technologies, and enhancing legislation on energy use management. The policies are helpful to optimize the trade-offs between economic growth and environmental protection in Beijing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

935,WOS:000425202900028,"While there has recently been an increased interest in urban and regional transitions to sustainability, there are little profound insights about the emergence, design and enforcement of regional transition paths to sustainability (RTPS). The latter are characterized by organizational and institutional dynamics that affect multiple regimes and cannot fully be captured with the niche-regime categories of the multilevel perspective (MLP). This paper is therefore based on recent approaches from evolutionary economic geography (EEG) that focus on how actors at the micro-level use the plasticity of paths to enact change. The transition path and underlying micro-dynamics over more than 30 years in the Augsburg region revealed in an empirical study are visualized in the form of a transition topology. The results show that RIPS do not exclusively originate in protected spaces. Actors use the interpretative flexibility of institutions and establish organizational proximity between different institutional logics thereby eroding institutional consolidations and allowing new configurations within the path. Gradual institutional changes lead to more fundamental changes in social practices over the long run. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper proposes a methodology based on the integration of two existing approaches and finalized to support designers, constructors, developers, and public authorities in the decision-making process. The first approach is based on a joint application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC). The outputs are proposed as an input to the second approach, the Strategic Choice Approach (SCA), considered as a preliminary platform in which information deriving from three specific disciplines (Materials Science and Technology, Environmental Technology and Real Estate Market Evaluation) could be structured, shared and accessed by stakeholders, in order to facilitate the decision-making process. First findings are illustrated through an application of the proposed methodology on a case study in the city of Turin (Northern Italy). The selected case study constitutes a reference building for the Turin area because it represents the building construction techniques that mostly need to be refurbished in order to reduce energy consumptions at building level and, as a consequence, at urban level.","Fregonara, E, Giordano, R, Rolando, D, Tulliani, JM",5,Turin,ITA,10.1080/10630732.2016.1157941,SRID=4326;POINT (7.68682 45.07049),870456,Integrating Environmental and Economic Sustainability in New Building Construction and Retrofits,2016

This dangerous pollutant is emitted by high temperature combustion and therefore its main source is transportation, which in turn is a consequence of an increase in population and better economic conditions. To examine the determinants of NOx emissions in the Community of Madrid, which is one of the most densely populated regions in Europe, we use an augmented STIRPAT model and a massive dataset which includes kriging estimates of pollution records and integrates various sources of information. Unlike previous research, we carry out our analysis at local level, where the relationship between socio-economic factors and environment becomes more complex, by considering the 179 municipalities of the Community over the period 2000-2009. Our results suggest a positive and statistically significant relationship between private transport-related variables and NOR. Interestingly, the coefficients of the variables related to public transportation are all significant with different signs. The overall outcome illustrates that policy makers should encourage a significant modal shift towards public transport and invest in attractive alternative means of transport and particularly railways in order to reduce transport energy use and mitigate pollutant emissions.

However, an economic analysis needs to be performed before its wide applications. To improve the economy of ASAHP from a design perspective, a year-round simulation and techno-economic analysis are conducted. Results show that the energy saving rate (ESR) does not decrease much when the relative design capacity of ASAHP is within 50-100%. At a relative design capacity of 75% in Harbin, 35% in Shenyang, 50% in Beijing, and 50% in Zhengzhou, ESR can reach 21.6%, 24.3%, 26.2% and 26.3%. Given an ASAHP price of 1.5 CNY/W and a gas price of 4.0 CNY/Nm(3), the payback period is 6.8, 6.6, 4.1 and 4.6 years in these four cities, at a 50% relative design capacity. There is a conflict between ESR and the payback period, but a small sacrifice (1.5-6.0%) in ESR can contribute a great reduction (38-48%) in the payback period. The heating period and energy price in the local area, as well as the expected ESR and acceptable payback period should be comprehensively considered for a better energy efficiency and economy.

939,WOS:000369915200007,"By combining daily (operations) and embodied energy demands, this work estimates life-cycle energy demands for residents and workers in different city settings. Using life-cycle analyses (LCAs) of different neighborhood types in Austin, Texas, this analysis fabricates five different city types, reflecting actual accessibility and resident and employment density profiles. Five residential and three commercial neighborhood types are distributed across 16-kilometer (10-mile) radius regions, with demographics held constant, for comparability. As expected, per-capita daily energy demands decrease with increased resident and employment density. Interestingly, embodied energy savings via increases in density are substantial. Though embodied energy makes up only 10-20 percent of total life-cycle energy, per-capita savings via density suggest it should be included in planning analyses. Overall, average life-cycle per-capita energy use ranges from 140 gigajoule (GJ)/year/capita in the least dense Orlando-style setting to around 90 GJ/year/capita in the maximum-density scenario, corresponding to a 35 percent reduction in per-capita energy demand.

940,WOS:000401594300025,"Many cities across the United States have turned to building energy disclosure (or benchmarldng) laws to encourage transparency in energy efficiency markets and to support sustainability and carbon reduction plans. In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1 million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2 kbtuisf and for residential buildings is 31.2 kbtu/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings- those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall- are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability.

941,WOS:000345691200014,"Numerous studies have shown that compact, mixed-use, transit-oriented developments contribute to reduced use of automobiles and in turn contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions. When everyday destinations are within walking distance, people are more likely to walk or cycle, and if transit is within walking distance people are more likely to use it. Other studies have shown that compact development enables reductions in building energy consumption that contribute further to emissions savings. The reduced emissions are assumed to rely on the combination of compactness and transit connectedness. However, this combination requires an extensive transit network covering large areas both of residential and of employment destinations. Such networks often do not exist and are too costly to construct. When they do exist, the transit networks often do not reach those outlying neighbourhoods with the greatest potential for future growth and densification. This paper therefore asks what emissions savings compact development can achieve in the absence of high-frequency transit. In an examinination of the life-cycle emissions of four variations of density in three different neighbourhoods in Vancouver, none of which is well served by transit, we found a wide range of emissions profiles. A mixed-use new urbanist development produced 22% fewer emissions than an adjacent development of large single-family homes, both of which were in a transit-poor area on the far edge of a suburban city. A high-density neighbourhood adjacent to a suburban city centre, and one adjacent to a central city centre, produced 50% and 67% fewer emissions than the neighbourhood of large single-family homes. Findings suggest that, while compactness may be most effective when it is coupled with high frequency transit, decoupling the pair and building compactness before or without transit can still yield considerable household emissions reductions.","Senbel, M, Giratalla, W, Zhang, K, Kissinger, M",2,Vancouver,CAN,10.1068/a46203,SRID=4326;POINT (-123.11934 49.24966),600000,Compact development without transit: life-cycle GHG emissions from four variations of residential density in Vancouver,2014
942,WOS:000255467500007,"Road transport is a major source of air pollutant emissions in European cities. Moreover, vehicle exhaust emissions have been the cause of much concern about the effects of urban air pollution on human health. Local authorities need to develop strategies to control vehicular emissions through technological and socioeconomical measures. For this reason, an efficiency assessment of possible future measures to reduce air pollution is required for future traffic planning, regulatory and fiscal initiatives. This paper presents the assessment of several mobility and technology scenarios that can be used for emission reductions in Madrid (Spain) in the period 2004-2012. Pollutants considered are those related to typical air quality problems in urban areas in Europe (SO2, NOx, NMVOC, heavy metals, CO and particulate matter) and CO2 as a greenhouse gas. Results show an expected increase in mobility but a decreasing trend in future traffic-related emissions, except for CO2. This reduction is due to technological improvements linked to European Legislation for road vehicles (Euro Standards). CO2 emissions are expected to increase because the technological improvements will not be able to counteract the effect of the large mobility increase. With regard to control strategies, the most effective measure for emission reductions is fleet renewal. According to the hypotheses made in the paper, this would reduce, on average, the pollutant emission by 16.04%. With regard to CO2 emissions, the use of biofuels and the decrease in mobility are the most effective measures. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As one of the pilot cities, Beijing has been pursuing low-carbon development strategies under state intervention and market regulation. This paper chooses the carbon market, a medium through which Beijing manages emission reduction, as the object of study. Firstly, we compare the basic construction circumstances of Beijing with other pilot cities. Then we qualitatively analyze the development of Beijing's carbon market from the perspective of transaction status, execution of the contract, and improvement of the policies and regulations. Finally, we use the TOPSIS model to develop a comprehensive evaluation system of Beijing's carbon market. It is used to quantitatively evaluate the operational performance and maturity of the mechanism. The results show that: Beijing's carbon market has good comprehensive capabilities, ranking second place among seven pilot markets; but the maturity of Beijing's carbon market is relatively poor for insufficient market liquidity; its operations are well managed, but economic efficiency still need to be improved; the depth of transaction and the effect of reduction in emissions make it meaningful. Therefore, in order to improve the construction of Beijing's carbon market, measures should be taken as follows:(1) strengthening the quota management, and increasing carbon trading activity to avoid poor market liquidity; (2) accelerating emission reduction actions and encouraging technology innovation, such as: carrying out several policies and measures supporting new energy and energy saving & emission reduction, and increasing investment and subsidy in research and development for the technology innovation of firms etc.; (3) improving regulatory mechanism and enhancing the disclosure of carbon trading, such as: drawing lessons from the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) about measuring, reporting and verification system (MRV).

This paper evaluates the effect of air intake height on the fresh air load for the plan of constructing thousand-meter scale megatall buildings in the cold region of China. The central difference from the conventional research is the consideration of vertical variations of outdoor atmospheric parameters around the air intakes at higher levels, and a mesoscale meteorological model, Weather Research & Forecasting Model (WRFv3.4), is introduced into this research to explore the vertical variation trend of atmospheric parameters in the cold region. Additionally, considering the common feature of cold region, the evaluation is illustrated based on the representative coastal and continental locations, as represented by Dalian and Beijing City in the region.

To address this information gap for cold climate markets, we report on the results of a recent survey of occupants of eco-house units in and around Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Participating households included those fully involved in the design, choice of technologies, and construction of their homes, and others who purchased an already completed dwelling. Survey findings reveal general satisfaction both with pre-occupancy support received from specialist contractors, municipal government, and neighbors, and with post-occupancy dwelling performance. Perhaps surprisingly, survey participants did not generally consider their decision to acquire an eco-dwelling to be more risky than selecting a conventional dwelling equipped with more familiar technologies. Although the purchase price was somewhat higher than for a conventional dwelling, few considered it to be substantially more expensive. Pre- and post-occupancy behavior comparisons mainly show an increased uptake of practices that are energy-reducing and eco-friendly. However, in some instances behaviors switched in the opposite direction, possibly due to the awareness of households that they were using more environmentally friendly energy sources.

Design/methodology/approach - By developing an in-depth case study using methods of organizational ethnography, the research traces phases of climate adaptation planning and implementation in Cape Town. Applied thematic analysis surfaces issues of coordination, decision-making, resource constraints and tracking progress as key constraints to urban climate adaptation. Findings - While considerable progress has been made on developing a citywide climate adaptation plan for Cape Town, implementation is constrained by poor monitoring and feedback within and between departments and a lack of oversight and impetus from central authorities within the government hierarchy. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed on the interface between technical and political decision-making, governance arrangements that facilitate coordination and iterative adjustment and the organizational uptake of externally commissioned work on climate adaptation. Practical implications - The paper points to the need for a climate adaptation coordination function situated higher up in the municipal government structure than the environment department to implement, monitor, evaluate and revise measures to reduce climate risks and vulnerabilities citywide.

948,WOS:000383297200011,"While (urban) resilience has become an increasingly popular concept, especially in the areas of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA), it is often still used as an abstract metaphor, with much debate centered on definitions, differences in approaches, and epistemological considerations. Empirical studies examining how community-based organizations (CBOs) ""practice"" resilience on the ground and what enables these CBOs to organize and mobilize around resilience are lacking. Moreover, in the growing context of competitive and entrepreneurial urbanism and conflicting priorities about urban (re)development, it is unclear how urban development dynamics influence community based resilience actions. Through empirical research conducted on the Lower East Side, a gentrifying neighborhood in Manhattan, and in Rockaway, a socio-spatially isolated neighborhood in Queens, we investigate community organizing of low-income residents for (climate) resilience in a post-disaster context. Results show that both the operationalization of resilience- how resilience is ""practiced""- and the community capacity to organize for the improved resilience of low-income residents are strongly influenced by pre-existing urban development dynamics and civic infrastructure- the socio-spatial networks of community-based organizations- in each neighborhood. The Lower East Side, with its long history of community activism and awareness of gentrification threats, was better able to mobilize broadly and collectively around resilience needs while the more socio-spatially isolated neighborhoods on the Rockaway peninsula were more constrained.

This paper identifies differences and similarities between three Medium Layer Super Output Area (MLSOA) districts in the United Kingdom (UK) and draws conclusions which prove to be useful to interpret other districts in the city and provide general rules for energy efficiency measures and distributed supply interventions in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, and potentially beyond. The core argument aims at provide an important link between the energy-reducing and energy-increasing effects of four urban morphology characteristics in 'place-specific' neighbourhoods. Our methodology explores the potential application of the close relation between four urban morphological characteristics and the spatial aggregated building energy end-use in the roll-out strategy of interventions. Our findings first indicate that the combination of shape and size of continuous building classes (in a building class the main residential buildings are grouped by their age and building type) and their extent using patch areas potentially simplify retrofit campaigns. We argue that the whole continuous building class influences the building's thermal mass (the building massing) and their extent (the patch area or patch in short) and these are better descriptors for the energy use in the occupational phase of a building. Second, the building massing and the plot ratio (the ratio of the building floor area to the land area in a given territory) are a better descriptors of building density/mixing of land use and built form leading to the potential use of adequate distributed energy supply. Third, the way in which social and economic factors interact to shape area-based of household energy consumption leads to a possible better spatially-enabled policies for low income families; and fourth, the layout and orientation design of the neighbourhood may identify municipal sites for potential renewable energy projects. The use of the building massing and patch areas as spatial cluster operators simplify the complexity of aggregated building energy consumption by representing its spatial incidence through a smooth continuous surface. Additionally, building classes and its patch area extent show notable differences across different sub-city areas. Furthermore, the greater the number of building classes, the more diverse is the socio-economic make-up of a sub-city area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We calculated the critical concentrations of PAHs in the urban soils of Nanjing, China based on a human health risk assessment. In the study area, the risk was divided into four levels and toxic equivalent values of benzo[ a] pyrene (BaPeq) corresponded to <70 ng g(-1), 70-700 ng g(-1), 700-7000 ng g(-1), and >7000 ng g(-1). By this standard, most urban areas in Nanjing fall under level II (potentially low risk), while older urban districts, commercial centers, and transportation centers exceed the critical concentration (level III) at present. Additionally, the correlations between PAH concentrations, factors associated with urbanization, and soil properties were analyzed. Population density and black carbon content were determined to be the key factors involved. Multiple linear regression models and the scenario simulation method were used to predict PAH levels in urban soils through 2030. The results indicated that the future distribution characteristics of soil BaPeq under various scenarios were different than at present, but PAH concentrations remained stable only under the low carbon scenario. Therefore, the consumption of traditional fossil fuels should be controlled and replaced with alternative energy sources. In addition, the growth of traffic land use should be controlled in the southern and southwestern parts of the urban area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

953,WOS:000392571200027,"A sustainable and secure food supply within a low-carbon and resilient infrastructure is encapsulated in several of The United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals. The integration of urban agriculture in buildings can offer improved efficiencies; in recognition of this, the first south European example of a fully integrated rooftop greenhouse (iRTG) was designed and incorporated into the ICTA-ICP building by the Autonomous University of Barcelona. This design seeks to interchange heat, CO2 and rainwater between the building and its rooftop greenhouse. Average air temperatures for 2015 in the iRTG were 16.5 degrees C (winter) and 25.79 degrees C (summer), making the iRTG an ideal growing environment. Using detailed thermophysical fabric properties, 2015 site-specific weather data, exact control strategies and dynamic soil temperatures, the iRTG was modelled in EnergyPlus to assess the performance of an equivalent 'free-standing' greenhouse. The validated result shows that the thermal interchange between the iRTG and the ICTA-ICP building has considerable moderating effects on the iRTG's indoor climate; since average hourly temperatures in an equivalent freestanding greenhouse would have been 4.1 degrees C colder in winter and 4.4 degrees C warmer in summer under the 2015 climatic conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the iRTG case study recycled 43.78 MWh of thermal energy (or 341.93 kWh/m(2)/yr) from the main building in 2015. Assuming 100% energy conversion efficiency, compared to freestanding greenhouses heated with oil, gas or biomass systems, the iRTG delivered an equivalent carbon savings of 113.8, 82.4 or 5.5 kg CO2(eq)/m(2)/yr, respectively, and economic savings of 19.63, 15.88 or 17.33 (sin)/m(2)/yr, respectively. Under similar climatic conditions, this symbiosis between buildings and urban agriculture makes an iRTG an efficient resource-management model and supports the promotion of a new typology or concept of buildings with a nexus or symbiosis between energy efficiency and food production.

Using four field methods (aircraft-based mass balance, tracer correlation, vertical radial plume mapping, static chambers) and a new field-validated process-based model (California Landfill Methane Inventory Model, CALMIM 5.4), we investigated the total CH4 emissions from a central Indiana landfill as well as the partitioned emissions inclusive of methanotrophic oxidation for the various cover soils at the site. We observed close agreement between whole site emissions derived from the tracer correlation (8 to 13 mol s(-1)) and the aircraft mass balance approaches (7 and 17 mol s(-1)) that were statistically indistinguishable from the modeling result (12 +/- 2 mol s(-1) inclusive of oxidation). Our model calculations indicated that approximately 90% of the annual average CH4 emissions (11 +/- 1 mol s(-1); 2200 +/- 250 g m(-2) d(-1)) derived from the small daily operational area. Characterized by a thin overnight soil cover directly overlying a thick sequence of older methanogenic waste without biogas recovery, this area constitutes only 2% of the 0.7 km(2) total waste footprint area. Because this Indiana landfill is an upwind source for Indianapolis, USA, the resolution of m(2) to km(2) scale emissions at various temporal scales contributes to improved regional inventories relevant for addressing GHG mitigation strategies. Finally, our comparison of measured to reported CH4 emissions under the US EPA National GHG Reporting program suggests the need to revisit the current IPCC (2006) GHG inventory methodology based on CH4 generation modeling. The reasonable prediction of emissions at individual U.S. landfills requires incorporation of both cover-specific landfill climate modeling (e.g., soil temperature/moisture variability over a typical annual cycle driving CH4 transport and oxidation rates) as well as operational issues (e.g., cover thickness/properties, extent of biogas recovery).",,0,Indianapolis,USA,10.1525/elementa.145,SRID=4326;POINT (-86.15804 39.76838),829718,Field measurements and modeling to resolve m(2) to km(2) CH4 emissions for a complex urban source: An Indiana landfill study,2017
956,WOS:000351119000011,"Rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have put public transit at the forefront of the push for more sustainable transportation. To improve transit accessibility and attract riders, agencies often build park-and-ride facilities on the periphery of cities. Through the provision of convenient parking facilities, agencies attempt to encourage drivers to shift modes and leave behind their cars to complete their journey by transit. Although park-and-rides are intended to increase transit ridership, such facilities may carry paradoxical environmental consequences. At issue is the degree to which such a multimodal car-to-transit trip actually offsets GHG emissions. The study reported in this paper examined single-occupancy vehicle (SOV) park-and-ride users in the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area and evaluated the magnitude of GHG emissions saved from transit ridership. Through a comparison of a multimodal trip against a theoretical SOY drive-only trip, the effects from GHG emissions were weighed. In addition, the environmental opportunity cost of park-and-ride stations was assessed through the repetition of the analysis under the assumption that all park-and-ride transit users that originated from within a 2-mi radius would shift modes to walk or bike rather than drive an automobile to the station. The results suggested that park-and-rides located at inner-corridor stations were far less effective in reducing GHG emissions than were end-of-line stations. This ineffectiveness appeared to be exacerbated by a parking fee structure common to both the inner-corridor and end-of-line stations. If the goal is environmental sustainability, the location of a park-and-ride facility at almost every station should be reevaluated in favor of a strategy that focuses on how and where park-and-rides can be most effective. The results of this study suggested that inner-corridor stations, particularly those closest to a downtown area, induced unnecessary driving trips and provided an incentive for longer SOY transit-access car trips.","Truong, LC, Marshall, WE",0,Denver,USA,10.3141/2419-11,SRID=4326;POINT (-104.9847 39.73915),682545,"Are Park-and-Rides Saving the Environment or Just Saving Parking Costs?

In this study, a cutting-edge urban canopy model is applied to assess the impact of a variety of controlled irrigation schemes for Phoenix. Results show that by increasing surface moisture availability for evapotranspiration, urban irrigation has a cooling effect on the built environment throughout the year. Maximum reduction in canyon air temperature can be more than 3 degrees C in summer as compared to the condition without irrigation. Among all investigated schemes, the soil-temperature-controlled irrigation is the most efficient in reducing the annual building energy consumption and the total cost. The total annual saving depends on the controlling soil temperature for irrigation activation, and can be up to about $1.19 m(-2) wall area as compared to the current irrigation practice.

Cleaner technologies advancement and optimal regulation on the transporting behaviors and related design in infrastructures is critical to address above issue. To understand the spatial and temporal emissions pattern within transportation lays the foundation for design on better infrastructures and guidance on low-carbon transportation behaviors. The feasibility of Global Positioning System (GPS) and emerging big data analysis technique enable the in-depth analysis on this topic, while to date, applications had been rather few. With this circumstance, this paper analyzed the taxi's energy consumption and emissions and their spatial-temporal distribution in Shanghai, one of the most famous mega cities in China, applying big data analysis on GPS data of taxies. Spatial and temporal features of energy consumptions and pollutants emissions were further mapped with geographical information system (GIS). Results highlighted that, spatially, the energy consumption and emission presented a distribution of dual-core cyclic structure, in which, two hubs were identified. One was the city center, the other was Hongqiao transport hub, the activities and emission was more concentrated in the west par of Huangpu River. Temporally, the highest activity and emission moment was 9 LOAM, the second peak occurred in 7-8PM, which were both the traffic rush period. The lowest activity/emission moment was 3-4AM. Causal mechanism for such distribution was further investigated, so as to improve the driving behaviors. Through the exploration of spatial and temporal emissions distribution of taxis via big dada technique, this paper provided enlightening insights to policy makers for better understanding on the travel patterns and related environmental implications in Shanghai metropolis, so as to support better planning on infrastructures system, demand side management and the promotion on low-carbon life styles.

968,WOS:000330325100028,"A consensus is forming among experts that the best way to achieve emissions' reduction in the near and mid-term is increasing the demand-side energy efficiency-this is especially true in developing countries where the potential for demand reduction is significant and achievable at relatively lower cost. Enhanced energy efficiency also reduces energy costs and can result in a financial benefit to end-users, if the life-cycle value of energy savings offsets the upfront cost of implementing the measure. At the same time, reducing energy demand translates into lower pull for fossil fuel import and supply/distribution capacity expansion. An ideal candidate for the implementation of demand-side energy efficiency measures is the building sector, since it contributes to a large extent to the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted worldwide. In most developing countries, the contribution of the building sector to the total national GHG emissions is significantly higher than the worldwide average. This is in part due to the lower level of industrial activity. Other drivers of the high emissions of the building sector are the inefficiency of the envelope and technical systems of the existing buildings, as well as harsh climatic conditions requiring the use of energy intensive air-conditioning equipment. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) currently have the highest ecological footprint per capita in the world. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the focus of this study, can be expected to have a footprint that is even higher, being the largest economy and the major oil producer among the seven Emirates. In addition to the environmental consequences of unrestrained energy consumption, the fact that energy prices are heavily subsidized in Abu Dhabi results in a significant financial burden for the government. In the UAE and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the air-conditioning load in buildings is the ideal target for demand-side management because it constitutes more than 60% of the total energy consumption. However, many sources of uncertainty still remain. How should we assess the life-cycle cost/benefit of candidate demand-side interventions? Which ones to choose in order to maximize national utility? This study will start to answer those questions by using a detailed engineering model of a typical Abu Dhabi building as specified by the Emirate's Urban Planning Council.

We surveyed residents of a recently constructed subdivision in Stockton, California, to assess their awareness of their risk of flooding. Median household income in the development was $80,000, 70% of respondents had a 4-year university degree or higher, and the development was ethnically mixed. Despite the levels of education and income, they did not understand the risk of being flooded. Given that literature shows informed individuals are more likely to take preventative measures than uninformed individuals, our results have important implications for flood policy. Climate-change-induced sea-level rise exacerbates the problems posed by increasing urbanization and aging infrastructure, increasing the threat of catastrophic flooding in the California Delta and in flood-prone areas worldwide.","Ludy, J, Kondolf, GM",68,Stockton,USA,10.1007/s11069-011-0072-6,SRID=4326;POINT (-121.29078 37.9577),305658,"Flood risk perception in lands ""protected"" by 100-year levees",2012

This article specifically looks at the utilization of industrial by-products (IBPs) (coal ash, foundry sand, and foundry slag) as aggregate for roadway sub-base construction for the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, urban region. The scenarios compare the use of virgin aggregate with the use of a combination of both virgin and IBP aggregate, where the aggregate material is selected based on proximity to the construction site and allows for minimization of transportation impacts. The results indicate that the use of IBPs to supplement virgin aggregate on a regional level has the potential of reducing impacts related to energy use, global warming potential, and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), PM(10) (particulate matter-10 microns), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb). Regional management of industrial by-products would allow for the incorporation of these materials into the industrial ecology of a region and reduce impacts from the disposal of the IBP materials and the extraction of virgin materials and minimize the impacts from transportation. The combination of reduced economic and environmental costs provides a strong argument for state transportation agencies to develop symbiotic relationships with large IBP producers in their regions to minimize impacts associated with roadway construction and maintenance-with the additional benefit of improved management of these materials.","Carpenter, AC, Gardner, KH",7,Pittsburgh,USA,10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00175.x,SRID=4326;POINT (-79.99589 40.44062),304391,Use of Industrial By-Products in Urban Roadway Infrastructure,2009

973,WOS:000341676100075,"Carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change. In the United States, the road transportation sector is one of the largest sources of these emissions. Any policies to reduce emissions must therefore include mitigation strategies for on-road transportation. The aim of this paper is to propose a multi-criteria method, Analytical Hierarchy Process, to rank various on-road emissions mitigation strategies including reduce, avoid, and replace strategies. The method's results are obtained based on a survey of transportation and climate science professionals. The Analytical Hierarchy Process was applied to two regional scenarios of a midsize-small city (Lubbock, Texas) and a metropolitan area (Dallas, Texas). To evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies, the Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator model was run for Dallas. The aim of the model was to estimate the potential carbon dioxide mitigation for a given strategy allocation. Our survey identified no difference between the rankings of reduce, avoid, and replace strategies for our metropolitan and midsize-small city areas. Reduce strategies had the highest preference score of 40% followed by avoid strategies with 36% and replace strategies with 24%. An optimum mixed mitigation scenario would achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions of 17% by 2030 from 2010 levels. The contributions of this study are two-fold. First, we evaluate generic scenarios in detail and apply them to a real-world case study. Second, the approach is both simple and generalizable. Applications of this type of platform include ranking transportation strategies on mitigating carbon dioxide emissions, evaluating the strategies, prioritizing budgets, and developing assessments of mitigation potential.

The key objective of the proposed model is to indicate the benefits of cooperation in terms of energy cost savings, carbon emission reduction and provision of energy self-sufficiency. The proposed cooperative configuration considers that buildings with different load patterns exchange power through a common DC bus, so that an optimum utilization of the energy generated by local renewables is achieved. The problem of selecting the optimal capacities of photovoltaic arrays, energy storage systems and inverters, as well as of determining the optimal daily power operation plan is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, where the objective function is optimized based on the Nash bargain method. The impact of the daily scheduling of the energy storage systems and electric vehicles, as well as the impact of power exchanges on the equipment sizing and vice versa is also highlighted.

As the link between food systems and climate change is increasingly acknowledged in the literature, the analysis of food policy regimes provides valuable lessons for understanding the dynamics of urban climate governance. Theoretically, we attempt to contribute to the fields of urban climate governance and urban political theory by applying URT as developed by urban political theorist Clarence N Stone and others. To this end, a 'building blocks' approach is introduced, facilitating and enhancing the analysis of the different elements of a regime, including initiation, coalition building, agenda setting, resources, cooperation, and consensus building.

976,WOS:000403031400027,"Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) plays an important role in moderating the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) effect, which poses threats to human health due to substantially increased temperatures relative to rural areas. UTC coverage is associated with reduced urban temperatures, and therefore benefits both human health and reducing energy use in cities. Measurement of this relationship relies on accurate, fine spatial resolution UTC mapping, and on time series analysis of Land Surface Temperatures (LST). The City of Worcester, Massachusetts underwent extensive UTC loss and gain during the relatively brief period from 2008 to 2015, providing a natural experiment to measure the UTC/LST relationship. This paper consists of two elements to this end. First, it presents methods to map UTC in urban and suburban locations at fine spatial resolution (similar to 0.5 m) using image segmentation of a fused Lidar/WorldView-2 dataset, in order to show UTC change over time. Second, the areas of UTC change are used to explore changes in LST magnitude and seasonal variability using a time series of all available Landsat data for the study area over the eight-year period from 2007 to 2015. Fractional UTC change per unit area was determined using fine resolution UTC maps for 2008, 2010, and 2015, covering the period of large-scale tree loss and subsequent planting. LST changes were measured across a series of net UTC change bins, providing a relationship between UTC net change and LST trend. LST was analyzed for both monotonic trends over time and changes to seasonal magnitude and timing, using Theil-Sen slopes and Seasonal Trend Analysis (STA), respectively. The largest magnitudes of UTC loss occurred in residential neighborhoods, causing increased exposure of impervious (road) and pervious (grass) surfaces. Net UTC loss showed higher monotonic increases in LST than persistence and gain areas. STA indicated that net UTC loss was associated greater difference between 2008 and 2015 seasonal temperature curves than persistence areas, and also larger peak LST values, with peak increases ranging from 1 to 6 degrees C. Timing of summer warm period was extended in UTC loss areas by up to 15 days. UTC gain provided moderate LST mitigation, with lower monotonic trends, lower peak temperatures, and smaller seasonal curve changes than both persistence and loss locations. This study shows that urban trees mitigate the magnitude and timing of the surface urban heat island effect, even in suburban areas with less proportional impervious coverage than the dense urban areas traditionally associated with SUHI. Trees can therefore be seen as an effective means of offsetting the energy-intensive urban heat island effect. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

The development of urban natural gas networks is an understudied response to such a challenge. Focusing on three cities, Istanbul, Cairo and Sfax (Tunisia), the article analyses the factors and the governance of these energy transitions. It uses a geographical approach to such processes that highlight the mutual influence of the territory in its material and political dimensions and of the policy goals and tools in the implementation. The development of urban gas networks rests upon the proximity of gas deposits. It is determined by metropolitan strategies for economic development as well as by programs aiming to cut energy subsidies. Though urban gas networks have a strong potential for restructuring the physical and social landscapes in cities, the dominant commercial approach taken by energy utilities and morphological constraints in the urban fabric limit their universalization. Natural gas is part of a mix of energies at the urban level and often competes with other energy forms, specifically renewables (like solar water heaters). Lastly, the development of urban natural gas networks sparks heated politics in relation to unfulfilled energy demand and affordability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, the status and future trends have been reviewed, which focuses on the private vehicles development, energy demands of road transportation sector and biofuels. Furthermore, a comprehensive survey has been conducted for 374 private vehicle drivers (owners) in Nanjing. A questionnaire survey method is implemented to collect information including respondents' awareness, brief of biofuels, selection attitudes to biofuels and views on policies. Furthermore, the biofuels selection motives of respondents have been concluded into two main factors, ""purchasing pressures"" and ""product attraction"". Then the respondents were divided into three clusters and compared. The results indicate that 90% of the respondents need to know more about biofuels implementation, and the majority of the respondents emphasize the active significance of reducing GHG emissions to improve energy security and mitigate energy crisis. But 55.6% of the respondents think that biofuels technology is still not mature. It is found that the different perceptions of biofuels between 192 passenger vehicle drivers (PVD) and 182 freight vehicle drivers (FVD). The former focuses on fuel price and fuel performance, while the latter pays more attention to fuel availability. Besides, PVD concentrate on fuel-related attributes while FVD focus on policy-related factors. The survey results give rise to some deeply consideration about the various preferences and awareness on biofuels among different consumer groups. These findings in this study will help to understand the consumer's energy consumption behaviors and improve the further implementation for biofuels in Nanjing city. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimating vehicle emissions based on second-by-second vehicle operation allows the integration of a microscopic traffic simulation model with the latest US Environmental Protection Agency's mobile source emissions model to improve accuracy. A factorial experiment on a test bed prototype of the I-4 urban limited access highway corridor located in Orlando, Florida was conducted to identify the optimal settings for CO2 emissions reduction and to develop a microscopic transportation emission prediction model. An exponentially decaying function towards a limiting value expressed in the freeway capacity is found to correlate with CO2 emission rates. Moreover, speeds between 55 and 60 mph show emission rate reduction effect while maintaining up to 90% of the freeway's capacity. The results show that speed has a significant impact on CO2 emissions when detailed and microscopic analysis of vehicle operations of acceleration and deceleration are considered.

992,WOS:000408788100021,"With around 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions directly or indirectly attributed to cities, attempts to mitigate climate change impacts must seriously consider urban carbon transformations. Two challenges are currently constraining urban planning decisions around decarbonisation. Firstly, a lack of detailed knowledge about city-induced emissions occurring outside of the city boundary hampers the design of mitigation strategies that involves the city's 'hinterland'. Secondly, the complexity of interconnections between industries and regions located upstream or downstream the supply chain of urban economic activity makes it difficult to implement specific, effective and efficient decarbonisation policies. In this study, a multi-scale, multi-region input output model with nested regions at city, state, nation and world level is employed to study the carbon footprints and the inter-sectoral linkages in terms of embodied carbon emissions of the two largest metropolitan areas of Australia, Melbourne and Sydney. The results show that imported emissions make up more than 50% of the city carbon footprints, with most of them attributable to goods (excluding food) and services (excluding electricity). This highlights the importance of promoting mitigation measures both within and outside of the city. The energy, mining and agriculture sectors usually located outside of city boundaries all have significant carbon linkage multipliers associated with city demand, indicating the need of pursuing carbon mitigation measures in these sectors. The linkage analysis pinpoints to crucial sectors that need to be targeted in future investments towards urban decarbonisation to minimise emissions and to maximise positive economic effects for urban and regional economies. The study also provides an improved understanding of the differences and similarities between Australia's two main cities. It is envisaged that this type of analysis will become increasingly relevant to other cities as the spatial resolution of multi region input output databases continues to improve.

993,WOS:000253786600005,"Due to initiatives such as the clean development mechanism (CDM), reducing greenhouse gas emissions for a developing country can offer an important route to attracting investment in a variety of qualifying project areas, including waste management. To date CDM projects have been largely confined to schemes that control emission from landfill, but projects that avoid landfilling are beginning to be submitted. In considering, the waste options which might be suitable for developing countries certain ones, such as energy from waste, have been discounted for a range of reasons related primarily to the lack of technical and other support services required for these more sophisticated process trains. The paper focuses on six options: the base case of open dumping; three options for landfill (passive venting, gas capture with flaring, and gas capture with energy production), composting and anaerobic digestion with electricity production and composting of the digestate. A range of assumptions were necessary for making the comparisons based on the effective carbon emissions, and these assumptions will change from project to project. The highest impact in terms of carbon emissions was from using a sanitary landfill without either gas flaring or electricity production; this was worse than the baseline case using open dumpsites. Landfills with either flaring or energy production from the collected gas both produced similar positive carbon emissions, but these were substantially lower than both open dumping and sanitary landfill without flaring or energy production. Composting or anaerobic digestion with energy production and composting of the digestate were the two best options with composting being neutral in terms of carbon emissions and anaerobic digestion being carbon negative. These generic conclusions were tested for sensitivity by modifying the input waste composition and were found to be robust, suggesting that subject to local study to confirm assumptions made, the opportunity for developing CDM projects to attract investment to improved waste management infrastructure is significant. Kyoto credits in excess of 1 tCO(2)e/t of waste could be realised. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

994,WOS:000367631000070,"An interval type-2 fuzzy fractional programming (IT2FFP) method is developed for planning the renewable energy in electric power system for supporting sustainable development under uncertainty. IT2FFP can tackle output/input ratio problems where complex uncertainties are expressed as type-2 fuzzy intervals (T2FI) with uncertain membership functions. The IT2FFP method is then applied to planning Beijing electric power system, where issues of renewable energy utilization, electricity supply security, and pollutant/greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation are incorporated within the modeling formulation. The obtained results suggest that the coal-fired power would continue to decrease and the share of renewable energy in gross electricity supply would maintain an increasing trend. Results also reveal that imported electricity plays a significant role in the city's energy supply. A number of decision alternatives are also analyzed based on the interval solutions as well as the projected applicable conditions, which represent multiple options with sustainable and economic considerations. The optimal alternative that can give rise to the desirable sustainable option under the maximization of the share of renewable power generation has been suggested. The findings can help decision makers identify desired alternatives for managing such a mixed energy system in association with sustainable development. Compared with the conventional optimization methods that optimize single criterion, it is proved that IT2FFP is advantageous in balancing conflicting objectives and reflecting complicated relationships among multiple system factors as well as in tackling various subjective judgments of decision makers with different interests and preferences.

995,WOS:000393003100030,"Previous well-to-wheels (WTW) analyses on electric vehicles (EVs) have reported tremendous results of potential energy and environmental effects. However, there remains a challenge to lower the uncertainties that were introduced when obtaining life-cycle parameters from a macro perspective (e.g., nationwide or regional scales). This study takes Beijing as a case, because it is an important regional hub for EV promotion and represents megacities with severe urban air pollution issues and congested traffic conditions. We collected up-to-date data concerning the eleetricity generation mix, fuel transport, end-of pipe controls, real-world fuel economy and emissions, and estimated the WTW energy consumption and CO2 and air pollutant emissions for various light-duty passenger vehicle technologies currently (2015) and in the mid-term future (2030). Unlike previous results, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are shown to significantly reduce WTW CO2 emissions by 32% for the present model year (MY) 2015 compared with their conventional gasoline counterparts, priniarily due to the shift from coal to gas in local power plants in Beijing and the significantly higher real-world fuel consumption of conventional vehicles compared with the type-approval value. By 2030, WTW CO2 emissions by BEVs should approach 100 g km(-1) due to the increased importation of non-fossil electricity, even lower than that of hybrid electric vehicles. Furthermore, significant improvements in end-of-pipe controls for coal-fired power plants have effectively lowered WTW emissions of air pollutants. In terms of VOCs and NOx that are of most concerns among all pollutants emitted from passenger vehicles, the WTW emissions of VOCs for MY 2015 BEV are already significantly lower than their conventional counterparts by 95%. Although WTW NO emissions for BEVs are currently higher by 66% than conventional gasoline vehicles, we expect that BEVs can achieve WTW emission reduction benefit of NOx (41%) by 2030. This study indicates the significance of fine-grained and real-world features when assessing the WTW energy and environmental effects of EVs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The city of Copenhagen has a bicycle-friendly infrastructure celebrated for its fine-meshed network. This study documents the spatio-temporal development of Copenhagen's bicycle infrastructure and explores how the development corresponds to other processes of urban transformation. The study builds on historical maps of bicycle infrastructure that are digitised into geographical information, which allows for a comprehensive analysis of the formation of the network. In search for identifying drivers, the study analyses the city's spatial growth pattern, migration pattern, development of road network and changes in the transport culture. Analyses reveal that the bicycle infrastructure expanded at a relatively constant pace during distinct periods of urban transformation, including periods when the city suffered from spatial, economic and demographic decline, and dominance of car traffic. By discussing reasons and demands for constructing bicycle infrastructure, the study identifies four distinct periods in which bicycle infrastructure was constructed to enhance comfort and safety (first cycling city); the flow for cars (car city); urban liveability for soft transport (liveable city); and, finally, to improve the flow for cyclists as part a strategic re-design of urban space (liveable cycling city).","Carstensen, TA, Olafsson, AS, Bech, NM, Poulsen, TS, Zhao, CL",5,Copenhagen,DNK,10.1080/00167223.2015.1034151,SRID=4326;POINT (12.56553 55.67594),1153615,The spatio-temporal development of Copenhagen's bicycle infrastructure 1912-2013,2015

Even though this has been widely acknowledged, only few papers exist that have studied cities holistically from a demand, i.e., consumption, perspective. The study presents a detailed analysis of the carbon footprint of two metropolitan cities from a consumption perspective. With the analysis of consumer carbon footprints (carbon consumption), the distribution of emissions in the key source categories is presented and compared. The study utilizes Finnish consumer survey data by cities, regional emission data for key processes, and general emission data to produce a hybrid LCA model for a holistic assessment of city-level greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption perspective. The study results showed the carbon consumption to be 13.2 t CO2e per person in Helsinki with a 17,400 a,not sign annual consumption expenditure and 10.3 t CO2e per person in Porvoo with a 15,900 a,not sign annual consumption expenditure, respectively. The dominant carbon sources for metropolitan living are heat and electricity, building and property, private driving, and services. Within the cities, some significant differences were found. The carbon emissions from energy consumption are 4.5 t CO2e for an average consumer in Helsinki, whereas an average consumer in Porvoo only causes 2.0 t CO2e due to the cleaner energy production in Porvoo. On the other hand, private driving causes 2.0 t CO2e in Porvoo, but only 1.3 t in Helsinki. The overall trip generation in Helsinki is only half of that in Porvoo, and also, the usage of public transport is at a substantially higher level in Helsinki. The current results contradict interestingly some earlier studies in finding that the theoretical carbon-reducing influence of city density is overridden with other factors, such as the type of energy production, energy efficiency of the housing stock, and increased use of services. In our study, Helsinki represents a metropolitan area with a denser structure and a more efficient public transport system, but still consuming around 25% more carbon emissions than the other city in the metropolitan area, Porvoo. The sensitivity analysis showed that even with the normalization of the key parameters between the two cities, the main finding still holds. The evaluation of the carbon footprint of cities from the consumption perspective, instead of a more traditional production perspective, seems to offer an interesting new insight into the carbon footprints of the cities. It identifies similar key sources of carbon as production-oriented studies but further emphasizes the significance of the utilized services in the carbon footprint evaluations. In the future, the carbon footprint of services, especially in the service-intensive economies and cities that tend to outsource their manufacturing and carbon emissions, should be further examined since they cause an ever increasing proportion of the carbon consumption of consumers.","Heinonen, J, Junnila, S",33,Helsinki; Porvoo,FIN; FIN,10.1007/s11367-011-0289-3,SRID=4326;POINT (24.93545 60.16952); SRID=4326;POINT (25.66507 60.39233),558457; 47192,Case study on the carbon consumption of two metropolitan cities,2011

The approach of the study involved a statistical analysis on the basis of the formerly 23 urban districts of the German capital of Berlin. Correlation and regression analyses of empirical data from the settlement structure, the traffic structure and income have found that the number of jobs per district and the share of the well-off population can best describe the CO2 emissions from traffic in Berlin. Also the number of residents, the total built area, the number of cars and the amount of traffic area are positively related to the dependent variable.

The other significant indicators are less able to be influenced by local and regional decision-makers-an alteration in the means of mobility to less CO2 emitting alternatives is needed if CO2 emissions from road traffic are extensively to be decreased.","Reckien, D, Ewald, M, Edenhofer, O, Ludeke, MKB",18,Berlin,DEU,10.1080/00420980601136588,SRID=4326;POINT (13.41053 52.52437),3426354,What parameters influence the spatial variations in CO2 emissions from road traffic in Berlin?

1006,WOS:000367762500106,"This paper describes the impact pathway approach for estimating an economic value of pollution effects of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) associated with bioethanol vehicle transport in Oslo as a climate policy. The approach rests on results obtained in an innovative measurement campaign and by means of air pollution dispersion-models, followed by an impact assessment and economic valuation of the potential externalities. This makes a state-of-the-art methodological technique to reach greater knowledge on the economic costs of urban air quality impacts resulting as a side effect of climate change policy. The social economic costs estimated in this paper are then compared to likely social economic benefits (i.e. avoided social economic damage cost) of reduced nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide-(CO2) emissions. The carcinogenic risk from long-term inhalation exposure to acetaldehyde emissions, leads in this paper to a moderate cost estimate associated with the combustion of bioethanol in vehicles in Oslo. Productivity and welfare loss is the dominant cost component, whereas the direct medical costs constitutes only a small part of the total social economic costs. The costs however, expect to be significantly lower than the combined economic benefits from reduced emissions of target compounds, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The label post-carbon builds upon issues beyond those of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy conservation and climate change, adding a broader set of concerns, including economic justice, behaviour change, wellbeing, land ownership, the role of capital and the state, and community self-management. The article draws upon a case study of an embryonic post-carbon initiative completed in early 2013 called Lilac. Based in Leeds, Lilac stands for Low Impact Living Affordable Community and is the first attempt to build an affordable, ecological cohousing project in the UK. Its three aspects each respond to significant challenges: low-impact living and the challenge of post-carbon value change; affordability and the challenge of mutualism and equality; and community and the challenge of self-governance. I conclude the article by exploring six lessons from Lilac that tentatively outline a roadmap towards post-carbon cities: the need for holistic approaches that deal with complex challenges, prioritizing self-determination rather than just participation, engaging with productive political tensions, adopting a process rather than an outcomes-based approach, developing strategy for replicability, and finally, embracing a non-parochial approach to localities.","Chatterton, P",31,Leeds,GBR,10.1111/1468-2427.12009,SRID=4326;POINT (-1.54785 53.79648),455123,"Towards an Agenda for Post-carbon Cities: Lessons from Lilac, the UK's First Ecological, Affordable Cohousing Community",2013

The urban authorities responsible for city planning are therefore responsible for defining the eco-efficiency of cities for decades to come. They need clear guidelines on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building stock in a specific area. The use of sustainably sourced wood in construction plays an increasingly vital part in the transition towards eco-cities. Drawing on an exemplary development site in Munich, this paper describes how the sale of building plots can be connected to an agreement to build with wood. Based on an actual research project, site-specific target values regarding greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of renewable material for specific building plots were developed by studying life cycle assessments for different buildings. Wood is introduced as a building material to achieve a minimal environmental footprint. The focus is set on linking the sale of building plots to an agreement to build primarily with wood.

Previously, mitigation had been almost the sole focus of policy-makers for fear of creating a moral hazard when concentrating more strongly on adaptation. Yet, with many of the climatic changes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected occurring faster than scientists predicted, adaptation has re-entered the debate as an imperative. In this context, in which adaptationa process often unfolding on deep timescalesbecomes prescriptive, it is crucial to look at the historical development of adaptive practices over the long term in order to appreciate the complexity of their evolution. This paper is a hybrid between a summary of a research project and a review of the most crucial literature on which it was based. The point of departure of this study was Hurricane Katrina, which, after it had flooded New Orleans on August 29, 2005, raised the question, how such a disaster could have happened in one of the most technologically advanced nations in the world. I then rewind to the foundation of the city in 1718 and work my way along case studies through three centuries of hurricane history in New Orleans. The red thread is the concept of adaptation. I review the definition of adaptation provided by the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC from a historian's point of view and suggest a slight change of perspective. Knowledge as a precondition for adaptation, contingency, path-dependence, political vulnerability, and the interplay of cultural, legal, and political factors emerge as crucial characteristics in the historical evolution of adaptive practices throughout the almost 300-year period of study.

Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) strategies provide a novel approach for urban planners to facilitate the urban carbon mitigation from transportation sector in long-term. While TOD strategies are emerging cases, they are merely qualitatively discussed in China, lacking practical indicators and quantitative verification for supporting the real urban plan. With such circumstance, this study aims to conduct an empirical and quantitative study on the applications of TOD strategy in Shanghai based on Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) and the updating data. Firstly, the changes of urban morphology were quantitatively analyzed by spatial cluster analysis, which reveals the layer structure changes and residents migration at about 1 km accuracy. Secondly, accessibility was selected as an indicator for urban transportation and estimated by method based on Time Cost Weighted Distance. Finally, the effectiveness of TOD was investigated by evaluating the integration between population and transportation accessibility with Geographic Weighted Regression model. Results highlight that TOD can effectively improve the transportation network with higher accessibility and lower urban carbon emissions.

Intensive nutrition intervention has not been implemented for Mexican pregnant women with diabetes. Its effect on different types of diabetes mellitus has not been studied. Purpose The authors assessed the effect of a medical nutrition therapy (MNT) program on perinatal complications in Mexico City. Methods Quasi-experimental design with a historical control. Women were assigned to a MNT program (n = 88) and were followed up with every 2 weeks until delivery (2004-2007). The control group (n = 86) was selected from medical charts (2001-2003) and the same inclusion criteria were used. In each group, 55% of women had type 2 diabetes mellitus and 45% had gestational diabetes. The MNT program included a moderate intake of carbohydrate (40%-45% of total energy) and reduction in energy intake, capillary glucose self-monitoring, and education. The control group received usual hospital routine care. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square, and multivariate logistic regression (OR, 95% CI) as indicated. Results Women in the MNT program had a lower risk of preeclampsia, fewer maternal hospitalization, and neonatal deaths in both types of diabetes. Low birth weight was less frequent only in women with gestational diabetes receiving MNT, while neonatal intensive care unit admissions were lower only in women with type 2 diabetes.

The carbon footprint embodied in each building construction material varies considerably under different conditions. This study aims to quantify the embodied carbon footprint of building construction materials used in Hong Kong with the consideration of local factors and to investigate how the region-specific characteristic would affect the result. A ""cradle-to-site"" system boundary was used, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, and transport until the material reaches the construction site.

It is indicated that for cement, decomposition of limestone contributes the largest to the total greenhouse gas emission over the life cycle, followed by fuel combustion. The surveyed cement plant performs at an average level in manufacture, but the import of raw materials increases the total emissions. For concrete, the major contributor is cement manufacturing. Comparison with other databases reveals that there is room for improvement in carbon reduction of the surveyed plants. The ""cradle-to-site"" results on cement and concrete show no significant difference from the ""cradle-to-gate"" results.

The UHI is maximized during summer (June-August) and characterized by asymmetric increases in minimum (similar to 1.1 degrees C/decade, p < 0.01) versus maximum temperature (similar to 0.1 degrees C/decade, p < 0.01) trends in excess of trends from regional climate stations. Comparisons of historical Reno temperatures with an ensemble of 66 bias-corrected and downscaled global climate model (GCM) outputs spanning 1950-2014 demonstrates cold biases of 1.5-4.5 degrees C during summer with minimum temperature having the largest bias. We show that a secondary bias correction step utilizing the statistical downscaling method of quantile-quantile mapping (QQM) can reduce biases in future climate projections assuming no changes to the UHI. The QQM results in an additional total warming of ensemble mean temperatures by similar to 3 degrees C for downscaled GCM output and similar to 4 degrees C for re-gridded 1 degrees grid resolution GCM output for 2030 -2049 under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario. These temperature differences produce additional increases in summer potential evapotranspiration of 10% compared to non-QQM bias-corrected GCM output. It was shown that the QQM method represents a useful and computationally efficient method for bias correction of temperature projections for cities where UHI effects exist. Planning and impacts studies of urban water resources can benefit from these improved climate projections, particularly in regions where downscaled GCM output is unavailable. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It explicitly avoids detailed air pollution concentration calculations and is therefore characterized by little data requirements, reasonable computation times for iterative calculations, and open-source compatibility. In a first step, the paper shows how to derive time-dependent vehicle-specific exposure tolls in an agent-based model. It closes the circle from the polluting entity, to the receiving entity, to damage costs, to tolls, and back to the behavioral change of the polluting entity. In a second step, the approach is applied to a large-scale real-world scenario of the Munich metropolitan area in Germany. Changes in emission levels, exposure costs, and user benefits are calculated. These figures are compared to a flat emission toll, and to a regulatory measure (a speed reduction in the inner city), respectively. The results indicate that the flat emission toll reduces overall emissions more significantly than the exposure toll, but its exposure cost reductions are rather small. For the exposure toll, overall emissions increase for freight traffic which implies a potential conflict between pricing schemes to optimize local emission exposure and others to abate climate change. Regarding the mitigation of exposure costs caused by urban travelers, the regulatory measure is found to be an effective strategy, but it implies losses in user benefits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The energy consumption of the residential and public sectors decreased drastically, while the transport energy consumption is still growing steadily. Decoupling of the economy as a whole (i.e., including materials) is not yet happening at any scale. The domestic material consumption (DMC) continues to increase, in parallel with the GDP. The rate of increase for DMC is slower than that for GDP in both Stockholm and Sweden as a whole (i.e., relative decoupling). The metabolism of the cities does not replicate the national metabolism, and the two cities each have their own distinct metabolism profiles. As a consequence, policy implications for each of the case studies were suggested.

By referring to the specific experience of the Province of Foggia (an intermediary government body in southern Italy), we also discuss how some recent changes in the Italian legislation, aimed at abolishing the provinces (considered as preferred supporting structure of the CoM), imposed the identification of another supraterritorial entity. This is to substitute the Province of Foggia as coordinator in the dialog between the local territory and the European Union institutions on the climate-energy theme. In this sense, the choice of the Chamber of Commerce represents a novelty. With regard to this, some considerations on the appropriateness of this choice are developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we analyse selected alternative scenarios aimed at minimizing the unused material fraction to be delivered to the landfill. The methodological framework of the analysis is the life cycle assessment, in a multi-method form developed by our research team. The approach was applied to the case of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Rome, with a special focus on energy and material balance, including global and local scale airborne emissions. Results, provided in the form of indices and indicators of efficiency, effectiveness and environmental impacts, point out landfill activities as the worst waste management strategy at a global scale. On the other hand, the investigated waste treatments with energy and material recovery allow important benefits of greenhouse gas emission reduction (among others) but are still affected by non-negligible local emissions. Furthermore, waste treatments leading to energy recovery provide an energy output that, in the best case, is able to meet 15% of the Rome electricity consumption. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study presents the Sustainable Urban Systems Framework for assessing the causes and effects of climate change involved with the built environment at different scales with a case study of Seoul, South Korea. The Seoul metro region is the sixth most densely populated area in the world, and the region's rapid population growth has resulted in dramatic increases in both energy consumption and land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes. South Korea is now the ninth largest Carbon Dioxide (CO(2)) emitter in the world and the third largest in Asia. Our results indicate that the system inputs and impacts of the proposed framework (urban population, LULC change, greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, and energy consumption) are closely related to the system pressures of energy security and GHG-reduction requirements. To meet the goal for the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol, Seoul must cut down its annual CO(2) emissions by 3.4 million metric tons. The city's current intervention strategies will result in a reduction of only 2.1 million metric tons a year, a deficit of 1.3 million metric tons. Our preliminary results indicate that the Seoul government can strengthen its CO(2) reduction strategy by incorporating built environment factors from the Sustainable Urban Systems Framework. By adopting energy-efficient-building standards, CO(2) emissions can be reduced by up to 1.34 million metric tons per year, suggesting a promising approach to lowering the city's energy use and GHG emissions.

We have chosen as a case study greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction policies chosen by the city of Geneva. The methodological approach consists in analysing EIA, SEA, SA and HIA conducted on three projects in three topic areas: urban planning, heating and transportation. These projects are: a complex urbanisation plan in an urban neighbourhood in Geneva (the Gare des Eaux-Vives project), a sustainable transportation plan for a central district in Geneva (the St-Gervais transportation project) and a strategy to encourage the City's employees to use sustainable transport for local business travel. The results show some shortcomings in the consideration of health in SEA, EIA and SA. This work highlights a narrow vision of health in SEA and EIA, limiting itself to a review of the effects of projects on the determinants of the physical environment as required by the legislation relating to these tools. EIA does not require the integration of the health dimension. As for SA, our research found that health is treated much more superficially than in HIA and primarily through the analysis of health and safety' criteria. It appears from this work that HIA is the tool which provides the most elaborate assessment, compared to SA, SEA or EIA, of the consequences for health of the GHG reduction policies chosen by the local decision-makers of a city. However, our study suggests that the HIA community should identify the situations in which HIA should be carried out and in which cases it is better to include health issues within an integrated analysis.","Diallo, T, Cantoreggi, N, Simos, J, Christie, DPTH",3,Genève,CHE,10.1177/1757975916686920,SRID=4326;POINT (6.14569 46.20222),183981,"Is HIA the most effective tool to assess the impact on health of climate change mitigation policies at the local level?

Different from the traditional development mode which merely relocating industries outside of the cities for pursuing sustainable development, eco-industrial development makes significant innovation by treating or utilizing wastes (i.e. solid wastes and waste energy) in a smart way for local industries to achieve a win win situation. In order to investigate the eco-benefits of eco-industrial development in China, this study focused on an industrial and urban symbiosis case of Guiyang city in which process synergy, municipal solid wastes recycling and waste energy utilization were incorporated in this typical industrial city. This city is resource-dependent, has many heavy industries, and these severely hinder sustainable development in this city. In order to promote eco-industrial development, an integrated coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban symbiosis network was firstly designed, with linkages between various industries through energy exchanges and process synergies.

In this study, the current energy situation of Nigeria is presented through a detailed literature review. The survey reveals that access to the national grid is limited, and the power delivered to areas classified as urban with grid connection is very unreliable. An initial assessment of the potential utilization of solar based technologies for electricity generation is presented for three strategically located Nigerian cities of Onitsha, Kano and Lagos. These cities are known for their large commercial activities, and their frequent power outages hinder their business and socio-economic development. The solar resources are modeled using synthetic hourly meteorological data for a complete year in typical meteorological year format On an annual basis, Kano has the largest average daily global horizontal resources (6.08 kWh m(-2)), while these resources are practically equal for Onitsha (4.43 kWh m(-2)) and Lagos (4.42 kWh m(-2)). For dual axis tracking, which maximizes utilization of solar resources, the monthly range of daily average solar insolation for all locations varies between 3.65 kWh m(-2) and 8.00 kWh m(-2). A standalone photovoltaic system on a tilted surface is sized to meet a representative household demand based on intuitive and numerical simulation sizing methodologies. These sizing methodologies are general and can be applied to any location. The estimated PV capacity and the corresponding unit cost of electricity ranged from 1.26 kW(p) at 0.206 USD kWh(-1) to 2.92 kW(p) at 0.502 USD kWh(-1) for the selected cities. The results show that the unit cost of electricity from the proposed standalone PV systems is lower than that for the widely-utilized diesel generators. It is concluded that standalone PV electricity is technically and economically viable for urban residential application in Nigeria considering the current infrastructure and energy policies.

For the latter, three measurement sites are available characterized by a varying amount of vegetation, which supports a detailed assessment of the representation of urban vegetation in CLMU. For Toulouse, observed roof, wall and road surface temperatures allow for a detailed evaluation of the anthropogenic heat parameterization. Overall, CLMU performs well in simulating the canyon and urban surface temperatures, anthropogenic heat flux and urban energy balance, with an overall better performance for the dense old city centre of Toulouse in comparison to the more vegetated sites in Melbourne. Results for the latter sites reveal that the pervious road fraction provides a reasonable approximation of vegetation in the urban canyon while the tile approach often results in an underestimation of latent heat fluxes. A detailed analysis of the radiative, turbulent and anthropogenic heat fluxes as well as surface temperatures for Toulouse point to a complex interaction between urban surfaces and canyon properties. Decoupling the roof from the urban canyon to the atmosphere aloft is shown to be important. Our findings suggest that more evaluation is necessary for contrasting urban geometries in order to obtain a better understanding of the interaction between the roof surface on the one hand and canyon air and air aloft on the other hand. The results simultaneously reveal a trade-off in errors between surface temperatures, radiative and turbulent fluxes and anthropogenic heat which again stresses the importance of the intended model application.

The question is: what are the viable solutions? One answer may be green roof retrofitting. The environmental benefits include reduced operational carbon emissions, reduced urban heat island effect, increased bio-diversity, housing temperature attenuation and reduced stormwater run-off. The economic benefits are the reduced maintenance costs and lower running costs. The social gain is the creation of spaces where people have access to green areas. However, the barriers to retrofitting include the perceptions of structural adequacy, the risk of water damage, high installation and maintenance costs, as well as access and security issues.

However, due to the increasing severity of urban environmental pollution issues and the development of a resource-saving and environmentally friendly social philosophy, the development of low-carbon and energy-efficient urban transport is required. This paper first defines vehicular trajectories and the calculation of vehicular emissions based on VSP. Next, a regression analysis method is used to quantify the relationship between vehicular emissions and delay, and a traffic signal control model is established to reduce emissions and delay using the enumeration method combined with saturation constraints.

1045,WOS:000370886700005,"The present paper proposes a multi-agent simulation model for analyzing the peak-shaving efficiency of natural gas TOU (time-of-use) pricing for residential consumers. Firstly, a natural gas price sensitivity function has been explored according to gas consumption characteristics of residential users, which establishes the residential users demand response model from the perspective of consumer psychology. Secondly, a TOU pricing multi-agent simulation system has been developed, which mainly includes a government agent, a gas operator agent, and seven residential user agents of different income level. Finally, this study takes Zhengzhou city in China as an example to simulate the dynamic change process of running states in the UGPN (Urban Gas Pipeline Network) under the residential users TOU pricing policy. The simulation results indicate that the maximum peak-valley load difference can be reduced by 11.12%, given the residential users' response to TOU tariffs, by shifting load and electricity substitution. The TOU price also increases benefits of gas operators, and reduces residential consumers' energy expenditure. Furthermore, the small ratio of the residential users' consumption will lead to the low peak valley load difference, but poor peak shaving efficiency and little gas operators' benefits. In addition, the expenditure on energy changes among different kinds of consumers; that is, the high and low income households have a large increased ratio, while the middle income households have a low increased ratio.

At the same time, cities struggle to find tools to help manage their long-term transition towards a low-carbon, resource-smart economy. In 2006-2007, the municipalities in the Helsinki metropolitan region organised an international competition for ideas titled ""Greater Helsinki Vision 2050."" It drew a good number of entries in the competition stage and later helped bring together the awarded participants with local planning professionals and citizens. This paper explores the process behind the vision-making exercise and evaluates its success in providing new tools for the long-term transition to a low-carbon, resource-smart Helsinki metropolitan region. The theoretical framework used in this paper is 'incrementalism with perspective' (Ganser, Siebel & Sieverts, 1993) and its ideas on using long-term visions in the integration and coordination of incremental activities in various institutions. We perceive the backcasting scenario method (Dreborg, 1996) as a tool for implementing this approach and hence interpret the case example's results through the framework of this method. The Greater Helsinki Vision 2050 competition was an example of a vision-oriented planning process that provided new tools for bringing the 'unmanageable' metropolitan region within the scope of the manageable. The backcasting approach was deployed as a tool'for emancipating stakeholders to imagine alternative futures for metropolitan spaces. The backcasting scenario method should be considered a viable tool when managing vision-oriented planning processes: longer than usual time horizons help initiate strategic learning among stakeholders. However, in addition to civil servants, citizens and other stakeholders should be widely engaged in order to secure sustainable results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, urban trees and forests can also be vulnerable to climate change through shifts in tree habitat suitability, changes in pests and diseases, and changes in extreme weather events. We developed a three-step framework for urban forest vulnerability assessment and adaptation that scales from regional assessment to local on-the-ground action. We piloted this framework in the Chicago region in 10 locations representing an urban-exurban gradient across a range of socioeconomic capacities. The majority of trees across a seven-county region had low to moderate vulnerability, but many of the least vulnerable species were nonnative invasive species. Urban forests in the 10 pilot locations ranged in vulnerability largely due to differences in economic and organizational adaptive capacity. Adaptation actions selected in these locations tended to focus on increased biodiversity and restoration of natural disturbance regimes. However, adaptation actions in more developed sites also included incorporating new species or cultivars. Lessons learned from the pilot area can be used to inform future efforts in other urban areas.

The paper begins from the starting contention that a wide range of social and cultural theory, urban planning and transport literatures position walking as a practice that unproblematically encourages social mixing', community cohesion' and social interaction'. Through the analysis of in-depth interview and diary data from research on urban walking in London, this paper engages with a series of underexamined questions. What, for example, is the nature of social interactions on foot? Who are they with, what initiates them and how do they unfold? How do these interactions relate to how we understand the relationship between walking and urban space? Attention is drawn to verbal and non-verbal interactions of strangers as they walk and to the significance of the practical accomplishment of walking together. However, an examination of the discursive organisation of diary and interview data extends existing work concerning the practical organisation of everyday pedestrian mobilities by considering the significance of participants' accounts of their walking experiences. This analytic move foregrounds a counterposition to dominant discourses surrounding everyday walking practices that is situated in the context of broader concerns with everyday urban politics and the right to the city'. This approach contributes to a clearer engagement with the socialities of urban walking whilst raising important questions concerning the ways in which particular walking discourses inform urban scholarship.

National and voluntary carbon-offsetting schemes are emerging as alternatives to international compliance markets. We developed a choice experiment to explore determinants of local forest carbon-offset valuation. A total of 963 citizens from Guadalajara in Mexico were asked to consider a purchase of voluntary offsets from the neighbouring Biosphere Reserve of La Primavera and from two alternative more distant locations: La Michilia in the state of Durango and El Cielo in Tamaulipas. Surveys were applied in market stall sessions and online using two different sampling methods: the snowball technique and via a market research company. The local La Primavera site attracted higher participation and valuation than the more distant sites. However, groups particularly interested in climate change mitigation or cost may accept cost-efficient options in the distant sites. Mean implicit carbon prices obtained ranged from $6.79 to $15.67/tCO(2eq) depending on the surveying methodology and profile of respondents. Survey application mode can significantly affect outcome of the experiment. Values from the market stall sessions were higher than those from the snowball and market research samples obtained online; this may be linked to greater cooperation associated with personal interaction and collective action. In agreement with the literature, we found that valuation of forest carbon offsets is associated with cognitive, ethical, behavioural, geographical and economic factors.","Torres, AB, MacMillan, DC, Skutsch, M, Lovett, JC",6,Guadalajara; Victoria de Durango,MEX; MEX,10.1007/s10113-012-0336-z,SRID=4326;POINT (-103.39182 20.66682); SRID=4326;POINT (-104.65756 24.02032),1640589; 457140,The valuation of forest carbon services by Mexican citizens: the case of Guadalajara city and La Primavera biosphere reserve,2013

Several air pollutants were measured at both sites before and after the implementation of the changes. In Ljubljana, a 72% reduction of local black carbon (BC), from 5.6 to 1.6 mu g/m(3), was observed after the restriction was implemented. In Granada, statistically significant reductions of 1.3 mu g/m(3) (37%) in BC and of 15 mu g/m(3) (33%) in PM10 concentrations were observed after the public transportation re-organization. However, the improvement observed in air quality was very local since other areas of the cities did not improve significantly.

1052,WOS:000402724900018,"Cities worldwide face the challenges of accommodating a growing population, while reducing emissions to meet climate mitigation targets. Public transit investments are often proposed as a way to curb emissions while maintaining healthy urban economies. However, cities face a system-level challenge in that transportation systems have cascading effects on land use and economic development. Understanding how an improved public transit system could affect urban growth and emissions requires a system-level view of a city, to anticipate side effects that could run counter to policy goals. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a case study on the rapidly growing Research Triangle, North Carolina (USA) region, which has proposed to build a Light Railway by 2026 along a heavily used transportation corridor between the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill. At the same time, Durham County has set a goal of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from a 2005 baseline by 2030. In collaboration with local stakeholders, we developed a system dynamics model to simulate how Light Rail transit and concurrent policies could help or hinder these sustainable growth goals. The Durham-Orange Light Rail Project (D-O LRP) model simulates urban-regional dynamics between 2000 and 2040, including feedbacks from energy spending on economic growth and from land scarcity on development. Counter to expectations, model scenarios that included Light Rail had as much as 5% higher regional energy use and CO2 emissions than business-as-usual (BAU) by 2040 despite many residents choosing to use public transit instead of private vehicles. This was largely due to an assumption that Light Rail increases demand for commercial development in the station areas, creating new jobs and attracting new residents. If regional solar capacity grew to 640 MW, this would offset the emissions growth, mostly from new buildings, that is indirectly due to Light Rail. National trends in building and automobile energy efficiency, as well as federal emissions regulation under the Clean Power Plan, would also allow significant progress toward the 2030 Durham emissions reduction goal. By simulating the magnitude of technology and policy effects, the D-O LRP model can enable policy makers to make strategic choices about regional growth.","Procter, A, Bassi, A, Kolling, J, Cox, L, Flanders, N, Tanners, N, Araujo, R",1,Durham,USA,10.1007/s10098-017-1343-z,SRID=4326;POINT (-78.89861999999999 35.99403),257636,The effectiveness of Light Rail transit in achieving regional CO2 emissions targets is linked to building energy use: insights from system dynamics modeling,2017

This study aims to assess the potential health risks and benefits of promoting active transportation for commuting populations (age groups 16-64) in six European cities. We conducted a health impact assessment using two scenarios: increased cycling and increased walking. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality related to changes in physical activity level, exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution with a diameter <2.5 mu m, as well as traffic fatalities in the cities of Barcelona, Basel, Copenhagen, Paris, Prague, and Warsaw. All scenarios produced health benefits in the six cities. An increase in bicycle trips to 35% of all trips (as in Copenhagen) produced the highest benefits among the different scenarios analysed in Warsaw 113 (76-163) annual deaths avoided, Prague 61 (29-104), Barcelona 37 (24-56), Paris 37 (18-64) and Basel 5 (3-9).

The scenarios would also reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the six cities by 1,139 to 26,423 (metric tonnes per year).

Shenzhen as the representative city has experienced rapid urbanization and population growth. Urbanization strongly changes the nature of the land surface and has a large influence on the regional ecosystems. In the process of urbanization, fertile cropland and original forest are often destroyed. It is important to regularly monitor the effect of urbanization on the natural environment so as to allow us to control the encroachment to a reasonable extent. Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important productivity indicator of the ecosystem. We obtained land covers from Landsat TM images to quantify urbanization of Shenzhen between 1999 and 2005. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-based) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, Landsat-based land cover map, meteorological data and other field data to drive the CASA productivity model and obtain net primary productivity for the study area. Finally, we estimated the effect of urban sprawl on regional NPP. The study on Landsat-based land cover maps indicated that a move towards urban is the most significant landscape change in Shenzhen City and urbanization has irreversibly transformed about 20.21% of Shenzhen's surface during 1999-2005. NPP loss mainly resulted from urbanization during 1999-2005 and totaled to 321.51 Gg of carbon, an average annual reduction of 45.93 Gg of carbon. For every square km of Shenzhen area, NPP was on average reduced by 0.0017 Gg of carbon during 1999-2005. The loss of NPP is equivalent to a reduction in absorption of 520.85 Gg CO(2) and release of 385.81 Gg O(2), so urbanization has a large influence on the regional net primary productivity.

1058,WOS:000414879300056,"Although energy-induced anthropogenic heat emissions form localized hotspots, they can influence the variability of urban climate. A lack of anthropogenic heat quantification in different locations and times has created a barrier in current research on urban climate. This study presented a distributed model of anthropogenic heat (DMA) that can be used for quantifying the temporal-spatial patterns of anthropogenic heat. The intensity of anthropogenic heat was estimated by separately considering the major sources of waste heat generated in urban environments from vehicular traffic, buildings, industry, and human metabolism individually. The contribution of anthropogenic heat to urban environments was assessed by the ratio of anthropogenic heat intensity to solar radiation (delta). The DMA was implemented inside the 5th ring-road of Beijing based on 6941 urban functional zone polygons which were attributed to seven zone types including agricultural, campus, commercial, industrial, preservation, public, and residential. Results showed that: (1) the total anthropogenic heat in Beijing reached 1.11 x 10(18) J per year. Buildings occupied 45% of the total anthropogenic heat fluxes, followed by traffic (30%), industrial (20%), and human metabolism sources (5%); (2) the mean intensity of anthropogenic heat peaked at 135 Wm(-2) in winter, 84 Wm(-2) in autumn, 82 Wm(-2) in summer, and 77 Wm(-2) in spring; (3) the contribution of anthropogenic heat to urban climate decreased in the order of commercial (delta = 0.5), industrial (0.47), campus (0.33), residential (0.32), public (0.32), preservation (0.09), and agricultural zones (0.07). This study indicates that a greater focus on energy reduction would be most effective in mitigating the effects of anthropogenic heat in commercial and industrial zones and in winter.

The impact of the HAMP on space relative humidity is investigated by modeling a one-storey office building in four North American cities (Chicago, Miami, Phoenix, and Saskatoon) as representatives of four major climatic conditions. The validity of the HAMP and resulting energy savings is represented and compared against the same building operating with two other HVAC systems: a conventional all-air system and a radiant ceiling panel (RCP) system with 100% outdoor air.

Within this game, users are able to consider a series of potential policy packages, such as low-emission vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimens, public transportation, walking and cycling, strategic and local urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and slower speeds, long-distance travel substitution, freight transportation, and international air, and select various levels of application to help achieve headline CO(2) emissions reduction targets. The roles of two external enabling measures, carbon rationing and oil pricing, were also considered. The paper considers an optimized policy package for 2025. A deep reduction in CO(2) emissions from the transportation sector is theoretically possible, yet difficult to achieve. The main perceived problem is in engendering an interest in the public to change consumer purchases and behaviors. The huge challenge now is to map out and discuss a variety of policy pathways to carbon efficiency in the transportation sector and then to enable and achieve a level of consumer and behavioral change consistent with strategic aspiration.","Hickman, R, Ashiru, O, Banister, D",11,London,GBR,10.3141/2139-20,SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853),7556900,Achieving Carbon-Efficient Transportation Backcasting from London,2009
1061,WOS:000072097400017,"Objective: To examine the relation between energy intake in childhood and adult mortality from cancer. Study design: Cohort study. Setting: 16 rural and urban centres in England and Scotland. Subjects: 3834 people who took part in Lord Boyd Orr's Carnegie survey of family diet and health in prewar Britain between 1937 and 1939 who were followed up with the NHS central register. Standardised methods were used to measure household dietary intake during a one week period. Main outcome measures: Cancer mortality. Results: Significant associations between childhood energy intake and cancer mortality were seen when the confounding effects of social variables were taken into account in proportional hazards models (relative hazard for all cancer mortality 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.24), P = 0.001, for every MJ increase in adult equivalent daily intake in fully adjusted models). This effect was essentially limited to cancers not related to smoking (relative hazard 1.20; 1.07 to 1.34; P = 0.001), with similar effects seen in men and women. Conclusion: This positive association between childhood energy intake and later cancer is consistent with animal evidence linking energy restriction with reduced incidence of cancer and the association between height and human cancer, implying that higher levels of energy intake in childhood increase the risk of later development of cancer. This evidence for long term effects of early diet confirm the importance of optimal nutrition in childhood and suggest that the unfavourable trends seen in die incidence of some cancers may have their origins in early life.",,123,Carnegie,USA,10.1136/bmj.316.7130.499,SRID=4326;POINT (-80.08338999999999 40.40868),7931,Childhood energy intake and adult mortality from cancer: the Boyd Orr cohort study,1998
1062,WOS:000412959600010,"The building sector is the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Over the years, sound tools have been developed to support the life-cycle assessment of building carbon emissions performance. However, most of these tools have been primarily focused on building-scale modelling and evaluation, leaving the emissions related to infrastructure and occupant activities as well as the carbon offsetting from implementing district-scale renewable energy systems, often neglected. The uptake of macro perspective carbon evaluations at the urban precinct level has been slow due to various barriers such as system boundary definition, quantification of complex inter-building effects, availability of comparable data, integrated modelling and uncertainties related to occupants' life styles. This research developed an integrated life-cycle model to support the precinct-scale evaluation of carbon footprint for a comprehensive understanding of the emission profile. This is expected to further support low carbon planning and (re)development of urban precincts. The model structure is underpinned by four major components at the precinct level, i.e. embodied, operational and travelling associated carbon emissions, as well as the carbon offsetting from solar energy harvesting. The utility of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through preliminary case studies on representative suburban precincts in Adelaide, South Australia. Comparative studies and scenario analysis are also involved to identify the critical elements affecting the overall carbon performance of urban precincts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, an insight into energy consumption and quantification of emissions from urban areas are extremely important for identifying impacts and finding solution to air pollution in urban centers. This paper applies the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) system for modeling the total energy consumption and associated emissions from the household sector of Delhi. Energy consumption under different sets of policy and technology options are analyzed for a time span of 2001-2021 and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O), total suspended particulates (TSP) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are estimated. Different scenarios are generated to examine the level of pollution reduction achievable by application of various options. The business as usual (BAU) scenario is developed considering the time series trends of energy use in Delhi households. The fuel substitution (FS) scenario analyzes policies having potential to impact fuel switching and their implications towards reducing emissions. The energy conservation (EC) scenario focuses on efficiency improvement technologies and policies for energy-intensity reduction. An integrated (INT) scenario is also generated to assess the cumulative impact of the two alternate scenarios on energy consumption and direct emissions from household sectors of Delhi. Maximum reduction in energy consumption in households of Delhi is observed in the EC scenario, whereas, the FS scenario seems to be a viable option if the emission loadings are to be reduced.

1065,WOS:000295803500003,"There is a strong connection between economic growth and development of cities. Economic growth tends to stimulate city growth, and city economies have often shaped innovative environments that in turn support economic growth. Simultaneously, social and environmental problems related to city growth can be serious threats to the realization of the socio-economic contributions that cities can make. However, as a result of considerable diversity of competences combined with interactive learning and innovation, cities may also solve these problems. The 'urban order' may form a platform for innovative problem solving and potential spill-over effects, which may stimulate further economic growth and development. This paper discusses how waste problems of cities can be transformed to become part of new, more sustainable solutions. Two cases are explored: Aalborg in Denmark and Malmo in Sweden. It is shown that the cities have the potential to significantly contribute to a more sustainable development through increased material recycling and energy recovery. Waste prevention may increase this potential. For example, instead of constituting 3% of the total greenhouse gas emission problem, it seems possible for modern European cities to contribute to greenhouse gas emission reduction by 15% through up to date technology and integrated waste management systems for material and energy recovery. Going from being part of the problem to providing solutions; however, is not an easy endeavour. It requires political will and leadership, supportive regulatory frameworks, realistic timetables/roadmaps, and a diverse set of stakeholders that can provide the right creative and innovative mix to make it possible.","Johnson, BH, Poulsen, TG, Hansen, JA, Lehmann, M",2,Aalborg,DNK,10.1177/0734242X11417488,SRID=4326;POINT (9.918699999999999 57.048),122219,Cities as development drivers: from waste problems to energy recovery and climate change mitigation,2011

Five hundred households in Taipei city were selected and interviewed on weekdays between 26 December 1986 and 15 January 1987 by using a stratified random sampling process.  By computing elasticities of the logit model, three kinds of energy conservation strategies - taxi-fares, exclusive bus lanes and gasoline price - were selected for sensitivity analysis.  The results show that a passenger's modal choice and energy consumption in transport are not affected greatly by the three selected energy conservation strategies in the short term.  Therefore it is recommended that other strategies are used, such as reducing trip generation, shortening trip length, improving fuel efficiency and increasing vehicle occupancy to reduce energy consumption in transport.","TZENG, GH, CHEN, JJ, LAN, CJ",2,Taipei,TWN,10.1016/0140-9883(91)90009-O,SRID=4326;POINT (121.53185 25.04776),7871900,THE INFLUENCE OF MODAL CHOICE ON ENERGY-CONSERVATION STRATEGIES IN TRANSPORT - APPLICATION OF A LOGIT MODEL,1991

A case study is presented that investigates the implementation of green roofs across the Melbourne central business district (CBD) in Australia. The study aims to give an immediately possible and best-case scenario for the benefits achievable depending on the proportion of Melbourne's roof area covered with green roofs. The following environmental benefits (EBs) of the retrofit are assessed for both scenarios for a city block: (EB No. 1) reduction in urban heat island (UHI) effect (EBUHI), (EB No. 2) reduction in runoff volume (EBR), (EB No. 3) improved water quality (EBL), (EB No. 4) reduction in storm water runoff peak flow (EBPF), and (EB No. 5) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction (EBGHG). These benefits are then scaled up, assuming that the retrofit of green roofs is expanded to cover the entire CBD roof area in the same proportions. This demonstrates the range and scale of benefits that could be achieved under widespread implementation, such as temperature reductions, significantly reducing the UHI effect, and estimated reductions of storm water runoff peak flow, which may mitigate or reduce the frequency and severity of flash flooding.

1068,WOS:000260366100013,"Durban is unusual among cities worldwide in having a municipal government that has developed a locally rooted climate change adaptation strategy. This paper considers how climate change came to be considered by local government against four institutional markers: the emergence of climate change advocates among local politicians and civil servants; climate change as a significant issue in municipal plans; staff and funds allocated to climate change issues; and a serious consideration of climate change issues within local government decision making. Considerable progress has been achieved on the second and third of these - but less so on the first and fourth. The paper highlights how climate change issues need to be rooted in local realities that centre on avoiding or limiting impacts from, for instance, heat waves, heavy rainfall and storm surges and sea-level rise, and also the ecological changes and water supply constraints brought about by climate change. To date, international agencies have paid little attention to adaptation, as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) has been prioritized. This paper also stresses the importance of building local knowledge and capacity about climate change risks and adaptive responses. Without this, decision makers will continue seeing environmental issues as constraints on development rather than as essential underpinnings of and contributors to development.","Roberts, D",95,Durban,ZAF,10.1177/0956247808096126,SRID=4326;POINT (31.0292 -29.8579),3120282,"Thinking globally, acting locally - institutionalizing climate change at the local government level in Durban, South Africa",2008

The perspective of carbon metabolism in urban communities can help in exploring the characteristics of metabolic behavior and structure, interactions among urban environment, communities and households, and thus unveiling the intrinsic drivers of carbon emissions. A conceptual model of communal carbon metabolism was developed to trace the metabolic behaviors in urban communities and applied to a typical community in Beijing. Results show that the communal metabolic system was mainly dominated by the carbon supply of household-induced energy from urban environment.

The absorbing efficiency and direct radiative effect of BC strongly depend on its mass concentration (M-BC) and type of emission source. In the present study, we report measurements of M-BC at the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), located at the center of the urban boundary of Tokyo, using an EC-OC analyzer from 2003 to 2005 and a filter-based Continuous Soot Monitoring System (COSMOS) during 2007-2010. The results indicate that M-BC have decreased significantly from 2.6 mu g m(-3) to 0.5 mu g m(-3) (similar to 80% reduction) between 2003 and 2010. Vehicular emissions are the dominant source of BC in Tokyo, and the observed reduction in M-BC is mainly attributed to the stringent regulations of particulate matter exhaust from vehicles imposed by the Japanese government. In addition, this observation is also supported from emission estimates using diurnal-weekly variations of M-BC in Tokyo and explains the observed reduction to within about 20%. This is the first clear evidence of a significant reduction in BC emissions in Tokyo and shows that measures taken to reduce BC emissions from traffic sources have a strong effect on air quality in a mega-city and also reduce the climate impact of traffic emissions. We highlight the importance of long-term and reliable measurements in detecting BC trends and for the validation and regulation of emission control measures in mega-cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The situation in Phoenix is particularly complicated by the large number of water providers, each with its own supply portfolio, demand conditions, and conservation strategies. This paper details spatial optimization models to support water supply allocation between service provider districts, where some districts experience deficits and others experience surpluses in certain years. The approach seeks to reconcile and integrate projections derived from a complex simulation model taking into account current and future climate conditions. The formulated and applied models are designed to help better understand the expected increasingly complex interactions of providers under conditions of climate change. Preliminary results show cooperative agreements would reduce spot shortages that would occur even without climate change. In addition, they would substantially reduce deficits if climate change were to moderately reduce river flows in Phoenix's major source regions, but have little effect under the most pessimistic scenarios because there are few surpluses available for re-allocation.","Murray, AT, Gober, P, Anselin, L, Rey, SJ, Sampson, D, Padegimas, PD, Liu, Y",5,Phoenix,USA,10.1007/s11269-012-0013-5,SRID=4326;POINT (-112.07404 33.44838),1563025,Spatial Optimization Models for Water Supply Allocation,2012

The carbon transfers represent the metabolic processes due to regional land use changes. We used the model to identify spatial heterogeneity in the carbon metabolic structure, functions, and relationships within the network. Data for Beijing from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, were combined with empirical coefficients, to construct the network. We used ecological network analysis to analyze the structure and function of the network, and to determine the ecological relationships between the components of the system, their distribution, and their changes over time. The analysis revealed that carbon throughflow of the network decreased and positive relations mostly outweighed negative relations. Exploitation relationships were the dominant type in Beijing during most of the study period, particularly in the northwest before 2000, but moved towards the southeast over time, leaving competition relationships with losses of benefits dominant in the northwest. Mutualism relationships with mainly beneficial carbon flows were dominant in the southeast, increasing in frequency in this region throughout the study period.

User behaviour patterns were comprised of the following parameters: (i) end-use water temperature; (ii) end-use water demand; and (iii) end-use time-of-use. For all parameters, two system types were assessed, namely: (i) thermosiphon systems with natural (passive) circulation in collectors and unstratified horizontal hot water storage tanks; and (ii) split systems with forced (pumped) circulation in collectors and stratified vertical hot water storage tanks. The performance of SWHs was analysed considering both energy performance indicators (i.e. total and peak-hour energy consumption, solar fraction and energy intensity) and level of service indicators (i.e. compliance with recommended hot water temperatures for Legionella spp. control and comfort levels). Notwithstanding the prevalence of thermosiphon systems among SWH technologies, results indicate that split systems usually outperformed thermosiphon systems both in terms of energy efficiency and level of service, and hence should be a preferred option for energy efficiency initiatives and policies.

Study of the variation in temporal CO2 emissions generated by the driving forces in Beijing can provide guidance for policy decisions on CO2 emissions mitigation in global metropolises. Based on input-output structural decomposition analysis (IO-SDA), we analysed the driving forces for the increment in CO2 emissions in Beijing from both production and final demand perspectives during 1997-2010. According to our results, the CO2 emission growth in Beijing is driven mainly by production structure change and population growth, partly offset by CO2 emission intensity reduction as well as the decline in per capita final demand volume during the study period. Final demand structure change has a limited effect on the change in the CO2 emissions in Beijing. From the final demand perspective, urban trades, urban residential consumption, government consumption and fixed capital formation are mainly responsible for the booming emissions.

Second, linear programming (LP) is developed and applied as a decision-support tool to analyze least-cost strategies for meeting co-control targets for multiple pollutants. We estimate that implementing PROAIRE measures as planned will reduce 3.1% of the 2010 metropolitan CO2 emissions, in addition to substantial local air pollutant reductions. Applying the LP, PROAIRE emissions reductions can be met at a 20% lower cost, using only the PROAIRE measures, by adjusting investments toward the more cost-effective measures; lower net costs are possible by including cost-saving GHG mitigation measures, but with increased investment. When CO2 emission reduction targets are added to PROAIRE targets, the most cost-effective solutions use PROAIRE measures for the majority of local pollutant reductions, and GHG measures for additional CO2 control. Because of synergies, the integrated planning of urban-global co-control can be beneficial, but we estimate that for Mexico City these benefits are often small.","West, JJ, Osnaya, P, Laguna, I, Martinez, J, Fernandez, A",25,Mexico City,MEX,10.1021/es034716g,SRID=4326;POINT (-99.12766000000001 19.42847),12294193,Co-control of urban air pollutants and greenhouse gases in Mexico City,2004

This paper established an embodied carbon accounting framework based on emergy to identify the input output structure and embodied carbon emission flows of the industrial park. An emergy-based embodied carbon indicator system was also set up to evaluate the low-carbon system performance. The case study of a typical industrial park in Beijing shows that the embodied carbon emissions of the whole process are mainly concentrated on the outside inputs, waste management and water recycling, of which the outside inputs have lower embodied carbon emission intensities than those of the waste management and water recycling sectors. The embodied carbon emission intensity associated with the exploitation of local renewable resources is lower than that of non-renewable resources. The embodied carbon-related sustainability indicator (ESICO2) is large, implying that the case park can sustain a balance between embodied carbon emission level and environment supporting ability. Particularly, the embodied carbon emission intensity of waste management per unit emergy yield is low, indicating that the environmental remediation cost of the total production of case park is relatively small.

1077,WOS:000336190000002,Nowadays the issue of electric energy saving in public transport is becoming a key area of interest which is connected both with a growth in environmental awareness of the society and an increase in the prices of fuel and electricity. One of the possibilities to reduce energy consumption in urban public transport is to increase the extent of regenerative braking energy utilization. This can be achieved by its accumulation in the supercapacitors or a change in the topology of the power supply system in order to facilitate its flow. The article presents an analysis of applying these two options for increasing recovery energy usage on the example of the trolleybus network in the Polish city of Gdynia.

Even less well documented and understood is how the sleeping thermal environment is affected by occupant behaviors such as the use of airconditioning (AC) and electric fans, or window operations. In this paper we present results from a questionnaire survey administered to assess summertime bedroom thermal satisfaction and heat-coping strategies among New York City (NYC) residents. Specifically, we investigated current AC usage in bedrooms and examined alternate cooling strategies, cooling appliance usage patterns, and the motivations that drove these patterns during the 2015 summer. Among survey respondents (n = 706), AC was the preferred heat-coping strategy, and for 30% of respondents was the only strategy used. Electric fan use and window opening were deemed ineffective for cooling by many respondents. Indeed, less than a quarter of all respondents ever opened windows to alleviate heat in their bedrooms. In general, people utilized strategies that modify the environment more than the individual person. Unsurprisingly, the frequency and overall use of AC were significantly associated with greater bedroom thermal satisfaction; however, setting AC to a lower temperature provided no additional benefit. In contrast, more frequent use of electric fans was associated with lower thermal satisfaction. In addition, 14.7% of all respondents did not have AC in their sleeping environment and 5.8% were without any AC at home. Despite the high penetration of AC ownership, usage cost was still a major concern for most. This work contributes to a better understanding of bedtime heat-coping strategies, cooling appliance usage patterns, and associated thermal satisfaction in NYC. The findings of this study suggest resident AC usage patterns may not be optimized for thermal satisfaction. Potential alternative cooling approaches could be explored to better balance maximizing thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption and environmental impact (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Future waste generation from 2003 to 2020 was forecast, and five scenarios of organic waste recycling in the municipality of Phnom Penh (MPP), Cambodia, were carried out. Organic waste specifically food and garden waste was used for composting, and the remaining waste was landfilled. The recycling scenarios were set based on organic waste generated from difference sources: households, restaurants, shops, markets, schools, hotels, offices, and street sweeping. Through the five scenarios, the minimum volume reductions of waste disposal were about 56, 123, and 219 m(3) d(-1) in 2003, 2012, and 2020, respectively, whereas the maximum volume reductions in these years were about 325, 643, and 1025 m(3) d(-1).

In 2010, the TMG introduced a mandatory CO2 emission reduction and a cap-and-trade scheme; the world's first such scheme that sets binding targets for buildings. The research was carried out through reviews of the published and unpublished literature, surveys and face-to-face interviews with various stakeholders involved in the policy process. The essential components that enabled successful policy-making and implementation of the scheme in Tokyo are revealed, such as the administrative leadership and the capacity of the TMG administration, the availability of historical data supporting the policy discussions and the gradual and flexible implementation mechanisms. The article concludes with recommendations for future improvements in the TMG and beyond.Policy relevanceThis article presents the lessons from the recent advancements in climate policy in Tokyo, particularly the world's first mandatory city-scale emission reduction and cap-and-trade scheme that includes buildings.

Moreover, there are abundant green energy resources reserved in Taipei. If they were fully developed, there would be 13,040 GWh electricity generated per year, resulting in a total of 937 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions abatement. The development of the green energy industry in this city not only can bring significant energy-saving and carbon-reducing benefits, but also may create huge derivative business opportunities.

Therefore, the study of suburbanization has received considerable attention in academia. Scholars have argued that suburbanization leads to ecological deterioration. To examine this viewpoint, the authors analyzed spatial-temporal changes in the ambient environment, the soil environment, the water environment, and other ecological environments, as well as carbon emissions of the central urban areas and the suburbs, in the suburbanization process exemplified by Shanghai. The results showed that suburbanization indeed caused many changes in ecological and environmental quality, but that the overall environmental quality in the suburbs of Shanghai remained better than that in the central urban area. It is important not to exaggerate the negative impact of suburbanization in metropolitan areas on the quality of the surrounding ecological environments. However, great attention must be given to controlling the diffusion of pollutants resulting from industrial and population suburbanization. It is also crucial to continue strengthening ecological environmental remediation, improvement, and recovery in the central urban area, and to comprehensively promote the coordinated development of agricultural modernization, industrial aggregation, low-carbon urbanization, and ecological sustainability, in both urban and rural areas.","Wang, HF, Wang, HF, Shi, YS, Zhang, AB, Zhang, AB, Cao, Y, Liu, HX, Liu, HX",0,Shanghai,CHN,10.3390/su9010124,SRID=4326;POINT (121.45806 31.22222),22315474,"Does Suburbanization Cause Ecological Deterioration?

In order to achieve co-benefits of reducing energy use, green-house gas (GHG) emissions and energy costs effectively, all respects related to the energy performance in the building sector need to be addressed. Considering the fact that over 80% of total energy use in a building's lifecycle is contributed by the operation stage, the study's focus is put on this stage for well understanding the energy consumption and carbon emissions and exploring the approach to achieve the effectiveness of co-benefits. The energy use in large commercial buildings is 4-6 times higher than residential buildings in China, thus IKEA Xuhui Store as one of large shopping malls in Shanghai is selected as the case study by using the method formed in the study. The outcomes of research show that the benefit of annual 170 MWh of energy use and 150 tons of CO(2)e reduction as well as the significant economic benefit have been achieved by implementing different measures in IKEA Xuhui Store between 2008 and 2011. Existing investment, technology and capacity barriers to co-benefits approach in a wider consideration of China's building sector are described. The assessment for evaluating co-benefits of cutting energy use and CO2 emissions in the production and demolition stages in a building's lifecycle are also addressed by the paper. However, it is very complicated to make a lifecycle assessment on the overall co-benefits in the building sector because of the complexity and the lack of available data for the research.

Drivers of fossil fuel use and air pollutants emissions were analyzed in metropolis of Beijing during 1997-2010. The analyses were conducted from both a bottom-up and a top-down perspective based on the sectoral inventories and structural decomposition analysis (SDA). From a bottom-up perspective, the key energy-intensive industrial sectors directly caused the variations in Beijing's air pollution by means of a series of energy and economic policies. From a top-down perspective, variations in production structures caused increases in most materials during 2000-2010, but there were decreases in PM10 and PM2.5 emissions during 2005-2010. Population growth was found to be the largest driver of energy consumption and air pollutants emissions during 1997-2010. This finding suggests that avoiding rapid population growth in Beijing could simultaneously control energy consumptions and air pollutants emissions.

1098,WOS:000317091400004,"This paper examines the link between formalisation of charcoal institutions and livelihood outcomes in Central- and West Africa. The woodfuel trade generally commenced informally, little controlled by legal or bureaucratic means. Developing formal institutions is often considered as a way of managing charcoal production more sustainably. However, formalisation can have adverse effects for charcoal producers and traders when this hinders their capacity to access the resource or markets. In order to assess the relations between the formalisation of charcoal institutions and socio-economic outcomes for those involved, this study combines a value chain and livelihoods perspective. A review of case studies and empirical data show that (I) West African countries, with a longer history of dealing with woodfuel issues, have more formal mechanisms in place to deal with charcoal management and these are more embedded into cross-sectorial energy and environmental policies; (2) Despite regulatory mechanisms dealing with woodfuel in all countries, institutions are mainly embedded in informal institutions and based upon customary rules, which allows large numbers of actors to be involved, but also leads to substantial unsustainable and unofficial production, corrupt practises and loss of tax revenues; (3) Formal mechanisms can have negative consequences, such as: conflicts of interests over tax revenues, difficulties in avoiding 'free riders' from sustainable management initiatives, and disproportional benefits reaped by more powerful urban-based actors. Comparing the West African countries with Central African countries where attention is relatively new, indicates that conditions for successful charcoal institutions are: devolving power and responsibilities for woodfuel management to a local level, monitoring woodfuel trade, (tax) incentives for sustainably produced charcoal and reinvesting taxes in social and environmental aims.

1099,WOS:000390624800002,"Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) is an emerging method for exploring energy efficiency solutions at urban or district scales. More versatile than statistical models, physical bottom-up UBEMs allow planners to quantitatively assess retrofit strategies and energy supply options, leading to more effective policies and management of energy demand. The most common approach for formulating an UBEM involves segmenting a building stock into archetypes, characterizing each type, and validating the model by comparing its output to aggregated measured energy consumption. This paper presents a more detailed methodology for setting up UBEMs while faced with incomplete information about the buildings. The procedure calls for defining unknown or uncertain parameters in archetype descriptions as probability distributions and, if available, using measured energy data to update these distributions by Bayesian calibration. The methodology is validated on residential houses in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Distributions for uncertain parameters are initially generated using a training set of 399 homes with monthly electricity and gas consumption records and then applied to a larger test set of 2263 homes. The procedure is applied both for monthly and annual metered energy usage data. Results show that both annual and monthly Bayesian calibration lead to significantly better annual energy use intensity (EUI) fits compared to traditional deterministic archetype definitions. As expected, an UBEM calibrated with monthly metered data more truthfully mimics monthly EUI distributions than one based on annual data, revealing the benefit of calibrating UBEMs using the smallest measurement time step available.

1100,WOS:000414627100023,"The implementation of renewable energy policies is lagging behind in The Netherlands. While several Dutch cities have ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the implementation of renewable energy projects has been rather slow. The main reasons for this are the limited institutional capacities of local decision-makers, low levels of social acceptance of renewable-energy technologies, and limited opportunities for engagement of communities in decision-making processes. In order to address these issues we have developed an interactive planning support tool named COLLAGE for stakeholder participation in local renewable-energy planning. The goal of this paper is to analyze whether the COLLAGE tool helps to increase community engagement in renewable-energy projects and planning by increasing awareness and addressing social learning issues related to renewable-energy options. We tested the tool in a series of workshops with stakeholders and citizens from the city of Enschede, The Netherlands. The workshop results show that the tool helped involve stakeholders and communities in deciding where to locate renewable-energy facilities. It increased community members' awareness of the benefits of and requirements for renewable energy by disclosing the spatial consequences of overall municipal goals.

1101,WOS:000284818100023,"With the increasing attention on developing a low-carbon economy, it is necessary to seek appropriate ways on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through innovative municipal solid waste management (MSWM), such as urban symbiosis. However, quantitative assessments on the environmental benefits of urban symbiosis, especially in developing countries, are limited because only a limited number of planned synergistic activities have been successful and it is difficult to acquire detailed inventory data from private companies. This paper modifies and applies a two-step simulation system and used it to assess the potential environmental benefits, including the reduction of GHG emissions and saving of fossil fuels, by employing various Japanese plastics recycling/energy-recovery technologies in Shenyang, China. The results showed that among various recycling/energy-recovery technologies, the mechanical waste plastics recycling technology, which produces concrete formwork boards (NF boards), has the greatest potential in terms of reducing GHG emissions (1.66 kg CO(2)e/kg plastics), whereas the technology for the production of refuse plastic fuel (RPF) has the greatest potential on saving fossil fuel consumption (0.77 kgce/kg-plastics). Additional benefits can be gained by applying combined technologies that cascade the utilization of waste plastics. Moreover, the development of clean energy in conjunction with the promotion of new waste plastics recycling programs could contribute to additional reductions in GHG emissions and fossil fuel consumption.

The objective was to measure the real impact according to trip duration, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, using two vehicles equipped with instruments, driven on predefined routes, at various times, before and after the putting into operation new equipment, and at a year interval. The study concerning the town of Amiens yielded results at a methodological level, in particular for fuel consumption measurements, and significant gains: significant reductions in total durations, stop numbers and stop durations are observed on some routes, systematically leading to consumption reductions. Consumptions vary considerably with traffic conditions (in a ratio of 1-2). Time is the preponderant factor in the variation of the analyzed variables. A microscopic analysis between intersections is used to identify with accuracy 'sensible spots', and the effects of the regulation system on a limited number of sections. An assessment study over 4 daily hours from traffic data yielded the following reductions: 7% on travel duration, 23% on stop duration, acid 3.8% on consumption, without an increase of speed. These significant gains show the advantage of this operation, at least in the short term. Gains mainly relate to off-peak hours, and concern a limited number of sections or crossroads. The evening peak hour is most inportant in the search for other increases, as it corresponds to over a third of travel durations and fuel consumptions (more than 1 litre/100 km as compared to average values).

The data have been used to create the first city-wide map of shallow groundwater temperatures in the UK. This map can be used both to support development of ground source heating and to act as a detailed baseline from which to measure change. Shallow groundwater temperatures under the city were found to be 2 degrees C warmer than the UK average groundwater temperature and this additional heat is attributed to the urban heat island.

Nearly 700 tonnes of MSW are collected daily, of which 97% is disposed of at landfills. The newest landfill was built using modern technologies, including a landfill gas (LFG) collection system. The rapid growth of Astana demands more energy on its path to development, and the viability analysis of MSW to generate electricity is imperative. This paper presents a technical-economic pre-feasibility study comparing landfill including LFG utilization and waste incineration (WI) to produce electricity. The performance of LFG with a reciprocating engine and WI with steam turbine power technologies were compared through corresponding greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction, cost of energy production (CEP), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) from the analyses. Results demonstrate that in the city of Astana, WI has the potential to reduce more than 200,000 tonnes of GHG per year, while LFG could reduce slightly less than 40,000 tonnes. LFG offers a CEP 5.7% larger than WI, while the latter presents a BCR two times higher than LFG. WI technology analysis depicts a NPV exceeding 280% of the equity, while for LFG, the NPV is less than the equity, which indicates an expected remarkable financial return for the WI technology and a marginal and risky scenario for the LFG technology.

1108,WOS:000370900400008,"Cities are major contributors to global emissions, producers of waste and consumers of resources such as energy, water and food: implementing green development strategies is hence a core challenge of modern city-planning. The attention of research has been focusing on the development of energy efficient, low carbon strategies, yet city decision-makers need truly integrated approaches, as the one proposed by the water-energy-food Nexus. The purpose of our paper is to investigate whether it is possible to take one step in this direction by extending existing approaches to energy efficiency strategies to progressively include other priority resources, in particular water. To test this hypothesis we have taken a robust and well accepted methodology, the ELCC (Economics of Low Carbon development strategies for Cities) developed by SEI and CCCEP, and we have extended it to the case of demand side water efficiency strategies for cities. We have then applied the adapted ELCC framework to the case study of the domestic sector of the city of Bologna (Italy), identifying and prioritizing several efficiency measures. Measures were evaluated through their capital investment, annual values of savings, payback period and reduction in consumption, and then aggregated in different scenarios in order to highlight potential urban investments and to showcase a possible approach to the prioritization of demand side water efficiency measures. The results show that, with an upfront investment of (sic) 17 million, a feasible subset of Bologna's households could be equipped with five selected cost-effective measures, generating annual savings of (sic) 10.2 million and reducing the total domestic water consumption of 34% by 2020 compared to the 2012 initial value. With additional (sic) 28.5 million, households could be equipped with more costly appliances reaching an overall water reduction of 37% by 2020. Our findings confirm that it is possible to successfully extend current approaches to urban energy efficiency strategies to include demand side water efficiency, adding an important building block to the construction of an integrated Nexus-based approach to green development strategies at the city-level. We encourage further tests to confirm the robustness of the methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon (C) storage and sequestration were quantified using urban forest inventory data and by applying volume-derived biomass equations and other models relating net primary productivity (NPP) and mean annual biomass increments. Industrial energy use C emissions were estimated by accounting for fossil fuel use and assigning C emission factors. Total C storage by Hangzhou's urban forests was estimated at 11.74 Tg C, and C storage per hectare was 30.25 t C. Carbon sequestration by urban forests was 1,328,166.55 t C/year, and C sequestration per ha was 1.66 t C/ha/year. Carbon emissions from industrial energy use in Hangzhou were 7 Tg C/year.

Therefore, this paper selected the most severely polluted Jing-Jin-Ji region (Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei urban clusters) to study the potential of mitigating both carbon and air pollutant emission. The Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model was applied and six scenarios were constructed by considering policies of environmental tax and renewable energy. Business-as-usual (BaU) scenario assumed no tax and fixed renewable energy to 2002 level, whereas other scenarios assumed that intensified renewable energy (RE) and tax on sulfur dioxide (SO2) (TAXI and TAX2) were implemented either alone or combined. The results indicated that both RE and SO2 tax could contribute to regional low-carbon development and air pollutant reduction, and the reduction is about 10-40% depending on scenarios. However, Renewable energy is always more effective in reducing CO2 and air pollutant emissions than TAXI but less effective than TAX2 for Hebei. From the sectoral perspective, power sector would exhibit both the largest emissions and reduction potentials in all three Cities, accounting for about 21%, 31% and 28% of total CO2 emissions respectively for Beijing,,Tianjin and Hebei, in 2020. Considering different policies, it is more effective for Hebei to apply renewable energy to reduce its power sector emissions in the long term, and tax policy is more effective for emission reduction from other sectors in Tianjin. Further analysis on the economic impact of mitigation policy revealed that Tianjin and Beijing would suffer relatively greater negative impacts than Hebei in terms of loss in total GDP, while developing renewable energy could help to reduce such negative impacts. It is suggested that the policymakers need to take into accounts the regional economic situation and natural resource potential when they formulate low-carbon policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the key measures to achieve such reductions as a way to mitigate and adapt to climate change is to increase food and energy self-sufficiency in residential areas. The objective of this study is to explore the potential self-sufficiency in terms of food and energy in generic residential districts in Singapore and Southeast Asia. Computational tools are employed to obtain quantifiable indicators based on sunlight availability. A series of building typologies and urban forms was created as abstractions from actual residential developments in Singapore (1.3 degrees N). In total, 57 cases were assessed in terms of sunlight availability and the impact of three density and geometry parameters: plot ratio, site coverage and building height were considered. Results from selected cases were compared to Hanoi's conditions (21 degrees N). The results show that the indicators having the higher impact on the food and energy self-sufficiency are plot ratio and building height. The cases with the lowest plot ratio (PR < 1.9) achieved food self-sufficiency when a hybrid higher-yield farming method was applied. Regarding energy harvesting, the cases with the lowest building height (<42 m) achieve energy self-sufficiency due to the maximum exposed area with PV per number of residents. In low-latitude regions, solar access is more evenly distributed among all facade orientations than in higher latitudes, therefore providing all facade orientations with food and energy harvesting potential. Food and energy self-sufficiency in equatorial regions is more heavily influenced by the available farming and PV area in relation to the total population than by the reduction of sunlight availability due to building typology and morphology.

1115,WOS:000340255700001,"BACKGROUND: While studies, mostly from Europe and Australia, have examined the effect of speed cameras on motor vehicle collisions, limited data exist regarding their impact on charges and number of patients taken to Level 1 trauma centers (L1TCs). Because of conflicting perceptions and data on their value, speed cameras were implemented along select Arizona highways in 2008 but then removed in 2010. The hypotheses of our study were twofold. (1) Speed cameras reduce admissions to L1TCs, and (2) speed cameras reduce crash kinetic energy, resulting in lower Injury Severity Score (ISS), mortality, hospital costs, and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to L1TCs who were injured in motor vehicle crashes along a 26-mile segment of interstate I-10 in urban Phoenix was performed. Patients were identified using both the Arizona State Trauma Registry and the Arizona Department of Transportation collision data for 2009 to 2011. This specific 26-mile segment of I-10 was selected because it contained at least one speed camera within 1 mile along its entire length from October 2008 to October 2010. Two time frames were evaluated: January 1 to December 31, 2009, when cameras were in place (2009 camera group) and January 1 to December 31, 2011, when no cameras were in place (2011 no-camera group). Variables analyzed include number of collisions, number of injuries, on-scene mortality, trauma center admissions, number of collisions with admissions, in-hospital mortality, ISS, hospital charges, LOS, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Five confounding variables were eliminated. Analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and linear regression. RESULTS: Camera removal was associated with a twofold increase in L1TC admissions as well as increased resource use. There were no significant differences between the two time frames for ISS, mortality, median charges, or median LOS. CONCLUSION: In this study, removal of speed cameras resulted in increased trauma center admissions and resource use.

Hence, a benchmarking of eight urban services provided in the city of Santander has been carried out: waste management; water supply; traffic management; street lighting; augmented reality and tourism; incidences management, parks and gardens and citizen participation. Among the main results of our study, we highlight that those public services properly managed embedding loT technology convey cost reductions in the long term. There is also a reduction in energy consumption and environmental impact with the consequent social impact. It should also be highlighted that most data are managed with the same platform. Last but not least, an emerging ecosystem of incentivized citizens has been proved to be arising.

Using the Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model we carry out an integrated analysis of the air quality regulations across different sectors for the city of Delhi. Our findings show that PM2.5 concentrations for Delhi will not reach the recommended national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) even by 2030 under the current policies scenario. Adopting advanced control technologies reduces PM2.5 concentrations by about 60% and all-cause mortality by half in 2030. Climate change mitigation policies significantly reduce greenhouse gases, but have a modest impact on reducing PM2.5 concentrations. Stringent policies to control the net flow of air pollution from trans-boundary sources will play a crucial role in reducing pollution levels in Delhi city. Achieving NAAQS requires a stringent policy portfolio that combines advanced control technologies with a switch to cleaner fuels and the control of trans-boundary pollution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

1119,WOS:000413176000003,"Dust transport and deposition processes are important for understanding the environmental risk of dust storms. This study investigated characteristics of dustfall at two rural sites and four urban sites from dust sources to downwind regions during three dust storms (DS1: March 19-22, DS2: April 24-26, DS3: May 7-10, 2010). Analysis of near-surface instantaneous maximum wind speed and prevailing wind direction revealed the dust storms bursted out from northwestern arid and semiarid regions to eastern China. Microaggregates, angular, subangular, columnar, subrounded, and spherical particles were identified by scanning electron microscope. Dust deposition flux (DDF) during the dust storms was significantly high at sites near sand deserts and sandy land. During DS2, DDF was 25.1, 9.9, 2.3, and 1.5 g m(-2) in Jingbian, Shapotou, Lanzhou, and Beijing, respectively. The three dust storms contributed 7.3% of Beijing's annual dustfall in 2010, which suggests anthropogenic dust might contribute the majority of annual dustfall in urban areas. The mass medium diameter of dustfall during DS2 in Shapotou, Jingbian, Lanzhou, and Beijing was 26.1, 9.0, 16.4, and 15.5 um, respectively. Urban dustfall contained more heavy metals, sulfur and arsenic than rural dustfall. Cadmium contamination was identified in all urban dust particles. Anthropogenic pollutants in combination with mineral dust might lead to complex environmental risk on local, regional, and global scales. China's environmental pollution control should integrate reductions in land desertification and multisource anthropogenic emissions within the context of climate change mitigation.

Are we talking about individual or group voluntary behavior change or a policy framework that seeks to encourage behavior change by regulatory force? Faced with an enormous literature that mixes related topics like sustainable development/climate change/energy conservation/low carbon, it is not surprising to hear about local governments' or planners' ""climate change initiatives"". This paper describes/reflects on how officials in Broward County, Florida, are dealing with issues of awareness, governance, measurement, and instruments for challenges arising from the combined threats of energy depletion and climate change. The overriding objective of this paper is to provide some pith for the discussion of planning for low carbon cities. To this end, we describe and reflect on the planning management responses of Broward County, Florida, USA - as an illustrative local government - in dealing with climate change challenges (CCC), energy conservation (EC) and greenhouse gas reduction (GHG). Both description and reflection are important as it is primarily the latter that provides the critical perspective necessary for assessing both potential and effect. The paper is organized into five sections. The first two sections address the ""contextual"" questions raised above: what is the level of knowledge and/or awareness among the collection of planners and/or local governments; and, what are/is appropriate responses of different levels of government. In the next section, we review overall levels of knowledge and awareness of basic science and policy dimensions, with particular attention paid to (a version of the) US planning profession. This is followed by a discussion of ""theoretical"" prescriptions for actions at different levels of government. The third and fourth sections focus on Broward County. The third section describes the county and presents a current measurement of its carbon footprint (at least at the level to which it can be measured). The fourth section describes the operational response of Broward County government. The final section returns to the original questions of knowledge and appropriate types of responses and argues that while the Broward response is generally effective in certain aspects, the current policy paradigm contains both strengths and weaknesses, which are generally outlined and discussed.

In this article, we introduced an infrastructure of alternative fuel as a synergistic approach to climate-adaptation and -mitigation, and advanced a quantitative method to simulate the dependency of travel behavior on fuel availability when the infrastructure of transportation energy is stressed or under attack. Our approach allows both commuters traveling behavior and properties of transportation energy system to interact. Featuring a multi-stage mathematical program, the proposed model was used to study the resilience of New York City's transportation energy sector in the face of a range of climatic extremes. We found the impact of the changing climate on energy sector is major and worsening over time. The modeling results also reveal spatial distribution of vulnerable elements in both transportation and fueling infrastructures, the system's overall resilience in time of disaster, and the daily-commuters impact of vulnerable energy infrastructure.

However, we may ask if the adaptation strategies and processes contribute to the greater resilience of port cities. Defining port cities as a system, this article examines this issue through the dynamic point of view of functional complexity, by analyzing the evolution, in time, of diversity (i.e. diversification of primary energy sources) and connectivity (i.e. development of intra- and inter-connectivity among industrial, agricultural and urban subsystems). Our research is embedded in and illustrated by the case study of Aix-Marseille-ProvenCe metropolitan port area (France). We show that the complexification processes of Marseille metropolitan port area are not linear and straightforward: they entail different phases characterized by different levels of diversity and connectivity. We identify co-evolving factors such as the development of new energy technological pathways, the emergence of a metropolitan dynamic or the change of business culture toward better cooperation, to explain these complexification dynamics. We discuss these results in regard to other metropolitan port contexts, especially in Asia, in order to assess to what extend the complexification processes of Marseille can enhance the understanding of global changes in industrial societies. We finally question the ability of these complexification strategies, implemented through industrial ecology approaches that do not deeply challenge the use of fossil energy, to respond to sustainability and resilience issues.

1123,WOS:000369491500013,"In this paper, we construct a spatially explicit model of carbon metabolism for the flows of carbon among the components of an urban area. We used the model to identify spatial heterogeneity in the ecological relationships within a carbon metabolic network. We combined land-use and cover type maps for Beijing from 1990 to 2010 with empirical coefficients and socioeconomic data to quantify the flows. We used utility analysis to determine the ecological relationships between the components of the system and analyzed their changes during urban development. We used ArcGIS to analyze their spatial variation. We found that the positive utilities in Beijing decreased over time and that negative relationships mostly outweighed positive relationships after 2000. The main ecological relationships were distributed throughout the entire urban area before 2000; subsequently, exploitation, control, and mutualism relationships became concentrated in the southeast, leaving competition relationships to dominate the northwest. Mutualism relationships were most common for natural components, but were not stable because they were easily disturbed by urban expansion. Transportation and industrial land and urban land were the most important contributors to exploitation and control relationships and may be important indicators of spatial adjustment. Increasing competition relationships unbalanced the carbon metabolism, and limitations on the area of land available for development and on the water resources led to increasingly serious competition. The results provide an objective basis for planning adjustments to Beijing's land-use patterns to improve its carbon metabolism and reduce carbon emission. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1124,WOS:000317295300008,"The UK has a number of main line railway routes that are not yet electrified. Some of these routes are under active consideration for electrification and the UK Government has recently announced the electrification of the Great Western Main Line (GWML). Railway electrification requires a large capital investment in infrastructure. Areas with limited clearance, such as tunnels and sections through overbridges, are particularly expensive to electrify. In this paper, train performance on the GWML, from London Paddington to Cardiff and vice versa, is modelled for three cases: no electrification; full electrification; and electrification that does not include tunnels, most notably the Severn Tunnel. The modelled trains were: the High Speed Train hauled by pairs of Class 43 diesel-electric locomotives; the nine-car Class 390; and Intercity Express Programme (IEP) trains formed as straight electric or bi-mode multiple units. Bi-mode trains combine electric and diesel traction in the same train. The considered IEP trains included both five-car and eight-car bi-mode options. Journey time, energy consumption and CO2 emissions were determined in each case. Electrification of the route will result in a reduction in energy consumption, carbon emissions and journey time, with the longest trains offering the greatest benefit. Under normal conditions, all modelled trains were able to complete the journey under discontinuous electrification. However, a small reduction in entry speed into the Severn Tunnel resulted in stalling of the exclusively electric trains. Bi-mode rail vehicles completed the journey in all cases and, as to be expected, also when tunnel entry speed is reduced; journey time, energy consumption and carbon emissions are not majorly impacted compared to exclusively electric operation.","Hoffrichter, A, Silmon, J, Schmid, F, Hillmansen, S, Roberts, C",1,Cardiff,GBR,10.1177/0954409712461341,SRID=4326;POINT (-3.18 51.48),302139,Feasibility of discontinuous electrification on the Great Western Main Line determined by train simulation,2013

The average alpha(a) values (similar to 3m(2)/g at 550 nm) for Sao Paulo samples are 10 times larger than a a values obtained for aerosols in Virginia. Sao Paulo aerosols also show evidence of enhanced UV absorption in selected samples, probably associated with organic aerosol components.

A feasibility case study was performed for the city of Rome, Italy. Several technologies are exploited and integrated in a single system, including a photovoltaic plant, a geothermal plant and a biomass digester for urban organic waste and sewage sludge. In the proposed configuration, the MEET could cover more than 11% of the electric power demand and up to 3% of the space heating demand of the surrounding urban area. An LCA analysis evaluates the environmental impact in a cradle-to-grave approach for two impact categories: global warming (carbon footprint) and land use (land occupation and land transformation). The functional unit is a mix of electric (49.1%) and thermal (50.9%) energy (kWh(mix)). The carbon footprint is 48.70 g CO2eq/kWh(mix); the land transformation is 4.058 m(2)/GWh(mix); and the land occupation is 969.3 m(2)y/GWh(mix). With respect to other energy production technologies, the carbon footprint is lower and similar to the best-performing ones (e.g., co-generation from wood chips); both of the land use indicators are considerably smaller than the least-impacting technologies. A systematic study was finally performed, and possible optimizations of the original design are proposed. Thanks to the modular design, the conceptual idea can be easily applied to other urban and non-urban scenarios.","Bonamente, E, Pelliccia, L, Merico, MC, Rinaldi, S, Petrozzi, A",11,Rome,ITA,10.3390/su71013564,SRID=4326;POINT (12.51133 41.89193),2318895,The Multifunctional Environmental Energy Tower: Carbon Footprint and Land Use Analysis of an Integrated Renewable Energy Plant,2015
1127,WOS:000414233200015,"The residential sector is the third largest energy-consuming sector in Mexico and an important contributor to energy related carbon dioxide emissions after transport and industry. The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation and social acceptance of energy efficient technologies and renewable technologies in the so called sustainable social housing program in Mexico City, and compare the real reduction of CO2 emissions to the theoretical potential. To do so, two estimations are developed: 1) the technical and economic CO2 emission reduction potential of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in new social housing in Mexico City, and 2) the real avoided emissions based on social acceptance of technologies obtained by housing surveys and physical revision of performance status of implemented technologies. We found that due to lack of information and training to households an important part of dwellers ended up rejecting mitigation technologies developing what we called the socially neglected effect of mitigation technologies. These results were used to estimate three scenarios for year 2025: baseline, mitigation and neglected effect. Due to the neglected effect a reduction of 25% with respect to the baseline scenario was obtained instead of 45% of emission reduction in year 2025. In the case of efficient lighting and refrigerators, where Minimum Energy Efficient Standards are in place the socially neglected effect disappears once the replacement of old to new technologies takes place. This result shows that minimum energy performance standards are the main mitigation policy to eliminate socially neglected effect in the long run. Obligatory standards for installation of solar water heaters can be developed as well, although it is important to develop additional follow-up policies for adequate installation of these technologies.

Hybrid vehicles are potential candidates due to their enhanced powertrain, and slower battery depletion and fewer lifetime issues, relative to full electric vehicles. This paper proposes a methodology to analyze the best theoretical hybrid powertrain candidate with maximum in-use efficiency, minimum life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and minimum additional cost, for a Lisbon taxi fleet case study. A multi-objective genetic algorithm integrated with a vehicle simulator is used to achieve several trade-off optimal solutions for different driving patterns. Potential improvements in taxi carbon footprint are discussed as a function of its lifetime, urban/extra-urban driving and maintenance/fuel life cycle uncertainty. Hybrid powertrains reveal to be advantageous comparatively to the conventional vehicle, especially in urban conditions. Specifically optimized solutions could reduce in-use energy consumption by 43%-47% in urban driving, and 27%-34% in extra-urban driving conditions, and reduce life cycle emissions by 47%-49% and 34%-36% respectively, relative to the conventional taxi.

It also aims to assess the emission intensity of the Ugandan ""charcoal production"" sector compared to that of some other major charcoal producing nations. This work was done in accordance with ISO 14040 methodology for life-cycle assessment (LCA), using GABi 4.0-a software for life-cycle assessment. A cradle-to-grave study was conducted, excluding emissions arising from machinery use during biomass cultivation and harvesting. The distance from charcoal production locations to Kampala was estimated using ArcGIS 10.0 software and a GPS tool. Emission data from a modern charcoal production process (PYREG methane-free charcoal production equipment), which complies with the German air quality standards (TA-Luft), was compared with emissions from a traditional charcoal production process. Four coupled scenarios were modelled to account for differences in the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted from the ""traditional charcoal production phase"", ""improved charcoal production phase (biomass feedstock sourced sustainably and unsustainably)"", ""transportation phase"" and ""utilization phase"". Data for this study was obtained via literature review and onsite measurements. The results showed that greenhouse gases emitted due to charcoal supply and use of traditional production technique in Kampala was 1,554,699 tCO(2)eq, with the transportation phase accounting for approximately 0.15 % of total greenhouse gases emitted. The utilization phase (charcoal cookstoves) emitted 723,985 tCO(2)eq (46.6 %), while the charcoal production phase emitted 828,316 tCO(2)eq (53.3 %). Changing the charcoal production technology from a traditional method to an improved production method (PYREG charcoal process) resulted in greenhouse gases reductions for the city of 230,747 tCO(2)eq; however, by using sustainably sourced biomass, this resulted in reductions of 801,817 tCO(2)eq. This study showcased and quantified possible GHG emission reduction scenarios for the charcoal industry in Uganda. The result of 3 tCO(2)eq emitted per tonne of charcoal produced, using earth mound method, can be applied to other countries in Eastern Africa where similar charcoal production methods are used; this will allow for somewhat better regional estimates of the inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of charcoal. The results of this study also suggests that the primary use of charcoal for cooking will lead to increases in GHG emissions and increases in deforestation on the long term, if legal frameworks are not made to ensure that biomass used for charcoal production is obtained via sustainable sources or if alternative cheap energy-generating technologies for cooking are not developed and deployed to the masses.","Ekeh, O, Fangmeier, A, Muller, J",2,Kampala,UGA,10.1007/s11367-014-0765-7,SRID=4326;POINT (32.58219 0.31628),1353189,"Quantifying greenhouse gases from the production, transportation and utilization of charcoal in developing countries: a case study of Kampala, Uganda",2014

However, little information is available on the energy content of foods offered by nonchain restaurants, which account for approximately 50% of restaurant locations in the United States. OBJECTIVE To measure the energy content of foods from independent and small-chain restaurants that do not provide stated information on energy content. DESIGN We used bomb calorimetry to determine the dietary energy content of the 42 most frequently purchased meals from the 9 most common restaurant categories. Independent and small-chain restaurants were randomly selected, and 157 individual meals were analyzed. SETTING Area within 15 miles of downtown Boston. PARTICIPANTS A random sample of independent and small-chain restaurants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dietary energy. RESULTS All meal categories provided excessive dietary energy. The mean energy content of individual meals was 1327 (95% CI, 1248-1406) kcal, equivalent to 66% of typical daily energy requirements. We found a significant effect of food category on meal energy (P <= .05), and 7.6% of meals provided more than 100% of typical daily energy requirements. Within-meal variability was large (average SD, 271 kcal), and we found no significant effect of restaurant establishment or size. In addition, meal energy content averaged 49% greater than those of popular meals from the largest national chain restaurants (P < .001) and in subset analyses contained 19% more energy than national food database information for directly equivalent items (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE National chain restaurants have been criticized for offering meals with excess dietary energy. This study finds that independent and small-chain restaurants, which provide no nutrition information, also provide excessive dietary energy in amounts apparently greater than popular meals from chain restaurants or information in national food databases.

1135,WOS:000378014600033,"Water supply throughout China has been depleting, and the management of these dwindling resources has posed new and urgent challenges. To address these issues, different water supply strategies have been developed and evolved. As a result, water conservation and management practices must evolve correspondingly. On the other hand, as water resource demands continue to grow, local utilities need to adopt and implement innovative measurement solutions as part of their water management practices(1,2). As an effort to bridge the gap, this research focuses on building a Smart Water-Supply System that can become an integral part of the city management and the building block of low-carbon residential environment to construct the Smart City at Guangzhou, China. Both the internal management and citizens service requirements are combined into the construction of the system(3,4). The designed system has the characteristics of details perception, economy and efficiency, self-healing control and interactive service. The demonstration of this smart system has achieved very good results by promoting users service level, improving the management of water supply operation, as well as reducing the energy consumption. The significant benefits that can be brought by the proposed system include: transparent water consumption to Water-Supply companies and end users, promotion of scientific and economic water consumption, large economic benefits to Water-Supply Companies, and assistant decision-making for social management.",,0,Guangzhou,CHN,,SRID=4326;POINT (113.25 23.11667),11071424,DESIGN AND DEMONSTRATION OF SMART WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEM IN GUANGZHOU CITY OF CHINA,2016
1136,WOS:000355023000013,"Hangzhou is a rapidly growing Chinese coastal metropolis that is facing climate change impacts, including intense heat waves, flooding and increased severity of storms (e.g. typhoons and thunderstorms). This paper examines whether green infrastructure (GI), specifically increased tree planting, could help Hangzhou City adapt to some of these impacts. The paper reports the results of a survey of Hangzhou green-space users and their disposition toward tree planting in public and communal green-spaces as a climate change adaptive response. Results show that surveyed green-space users tended to favor tree planting as an adaptive strategy if they were older, believed that individual actions could reduce climate change impacts, and believed that future climate change impacts would be economically disruptive. Few respondents reported tree costs (disservices). While the perceived benefits of urban trees were unrelated to support for urban greening, results suggest that under some conditions, residents may be willing to support increased tree cover within urban public and communal open spaces. Findings suggest land use planners and environmental managers in China would do well to cultivate support for green infrastructure interventions among older green-space users and residents who perceive personal costs associated with climate change. Additional research across a range of Chinese cities, and internationally, could further assist in evaluating the efficacy of green infrastructure for climate change adaptation from a green-space user perspective. Particular attention will need to be given to the potential costs of large-scale tree planting (e.g. health impacts) and to the utility of GI for macro-scale climate change response.

A solar prototype built in the city of Boussaada is studied under the climate of Ouargla city to show the importance of the use of passive solar architecture. The results highlight the importance of using passive solar techniques to reduce heating energy needs. Energy savings are realized with passive techniques even before the use of active solar systems. It is possible to cover the energy requirements with the use of hybrid PV/T water solar collectors. High solar thermal fractions for domestic hot water are achieved during the year. Solar electricity produced is high and can cover the annual needs of domestic hot water, air conditioning and heating, lighting and household equipment of the prototype. A part of the difference in area between that used to cover the thermal requirements of domestic hot water and the total area of the PV/T collectors is used for supplying a solar still. An increase in the annual production of 2.97 times is obtained compared to passive solar still. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Urban forests have been shown to provide countless ecosystem benefits with many addressing climate change issues, such as sequestering carbon, reducing air pollution, and decreasing the heat island effect. Individual groups within the American public may not respond to the issue of climate change in the same way, thus engaging each group in climate change solutions will require different approaches. It is therefore important to understand how the public perceives climate change, their values and preferences, and barriers that might constrain their engagement to policy solutions. A mail survey was implemented, focused on households willingness to support and pay for urban forests as a climate change mitigation method. Atlanta, Georgia, USA was selected for this study given its environmental issues such as heat island effect and land cover changes, including conversion of forestland, that come with rapid population growth and urban sprawl. A Tobit model was used to model willingness-to-pay as a function of several variables derived from survey results; and a multivariate weighting strategy was used to address nonresponse issues. The analysis showed that Atlanta households are willing to pay $1.05 million to $1.22 million per year, or $5.24 to $6.11 million over a five-year period. The WTP amount was significantly related with the residents income, media source from where they received climate information, and the relative coverage of tree canopy around their residence. Results are relevant to city managers who are interested in understanding the public value of urban greening programs and developing strategies or policies to expand urban forests as part of a climate change strategy.

In this study, a robust flexible probabilistic programming (RFPP) method is developed for planning municipal energy system (MES) with considering peak electricity prices (PEPs) and electric vehicles (EVs), where multiple uncertainties regarded as intervals, probability distributions and flexibilities as well as their combinations can be effectively reflected. The RFPP-MES model is then applied to planning Qingdao's MES, where electrical load of 24-h time is simulated based on Monte Carlo. Results reveal that: (a) different time intervals lead to changes of energy supply patterns, the energy supply patterns would tend to the transition from self-supporting dominated (i.e. in valley hours) to outsourcing-dominated (i.e. in peak hours); (b) 15.9% of total imported electricity expense would be reduced compared to that without considering PEPs; (c) with considering EVs, the CO2 emissions of Qingdao's transportation could be reduced directly and the reduction rate would be 2.5%.

1140,WOS:000082257400004,"This study quantifies the contribution through energy consumption, to the heat island phenomena and discussed how reductions in energy consumption could mitigate impacts on the urban thermal environment. Very detailed maps of anthropogenic heat in Tokyo were drawn with data from energy statistics and a very detailed digital geographic land use data set including the number of stories of building at each grid point. Animated computer graphics of the annual and diurnal variability in Tokyo's anthropogenic heat were also prepared with the same data sources. These outputs characterize scenarios of anthropogenic heat emission and can be applied to a numerical simulation model of the local climate. The anthropogenic heat flux in central Tokyo exceeded 400 W m(-2) in daytime, and the maximum value was 1590 W m-2 in winter. The hot water supply in offices and hotels contributed 51% of this 1590 W m-2. The anthropogenic heat flux from the household sector in the suburbs reached about 30 W m-2 at night. Numerical simulations of urban climate in Tokyo were performed by referring to these maps. A heat island appeared evident in winter because of weakness of the sea breeze from Tokyo Bay. At 8 p.m., several peaks of high-temperature appeared, around Otemachi, Shinjuku and Ikebukuro; the areas with the largest anthropogenic heat fluxes. In summer the shortwave radiation was strong and the influence of anthropogenic heat was relatively small. In winter, on the other hand, the shortwave radiation was weak and the influence of anthropogenic heat was relatively large.

1141,WOS:000373863300015,"A key factor to energy-efficiency of heating in buildings is the behavior of households, in particular how they ventilate rooms. Energy demand can be reduced by behavioral change; devices can support this by giving feedback to consumers on their behavior. One such feedback device, called the 'CO2 meter', shows indoor air-quality in the colors of a traffic light to motivate so called 'shock ventilation', which is energy efficient ventilation behavior. The following effects of the 'CO2 meter' are analyzed: (1) the effect of the device on ventilation behavior within households, (2) the diffusion of 'CO2 meter' to other households, and (3) the diffusion of changed behavior to households that do not adopt a 'CO2 meter'. An agent-based model of these processes for the city of Bottrop (Germany) was developed using a variety of data sources. The model shows that the 'CO2 meter' would increase adoption of energy-efficient ventilation by c. 12% and reduce heating demand by c. 1% within 15 years. Technology diffusion was found to explain at least c. 54% of the estimated energy savings; behavior diffusion explains up to 46%.

The past decades have seen significant improvements in building energy efficiency through the introduction of new building regulations and the construction of low energy buildings. However, the expected energy reduction has not been observed, largely due to the complicated and hard-to-predict nature of occupant behavior. This paper explores the impact of occupants on residential energy consumption in China. Surveys related to behavior and energy use in the city of Hangzhou were collected in the winter (n = 642) and summer (n = 838). Findings show that occupant age is a more significant factor than income. Contrary to existing research, a negative correlation between occupant age and energy consumption was found in this study. Elderly residents exhibit a more frugal behavior pattern than the younger ones. In addition, this paper reveals that household socio-economic and behavior variables are able to explain 28.8% of the variation in heating and cooling energy consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

1143,WOS:000423001900049,"With the Rise of Central China Plan, the central region has had a great opportunity to develop its economy and improve its original industrial structure. However, this region is also under pressure to protect its environment, keep its development sustainable and reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, accurately estimating the temporal and spatial dynamics of CO2 emissions and analysing the factors influencing these emissions are especially important. This paper estimates the CO2 emissions derived from the fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes of 18 central cities in China between 2000 and 2014. The results indicate that these 18 cities, which contain an average of 6.57% of the population and 7.91% of the GDP, contribute 13% of China's total CO2 emissions. The highest cumulative CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2014 were from Taiyuan and Wuhan, with values of 2268.57 and 1847.59 million tons, accounting for 19.21% and 15.64% of the total among these cities, respectively. Therefore, the CO2 emissions in the Taiyuan urban agglomeration and Wuhan urban agglomeration represented 28.53% and 20.14% of the total CO2 emissions from the 18 cities, respectively. The three cities in the Zhongyuan urban agglomeration also accounted for a second highest proportion of emissions at 23.51%. With the proposal and implementation of the Rise of Central China Plan in 2004, the annual average growth rate of total CO2 emissions gradually decreased and was lower in the periods from 2005 to 2010 (5.44%) and 2010 to 2014 (5.61%) compared with the rate prior to 2005 (12.23%). When the 47 socioeconomic sectors were classified into 12 categories, ""power generation"" contributed the most to the total cumulative CO2 emissions at 36.51%, followed by the ""non-metal and metal industry"", ""petroleum and chemical industry"", and ""mining"" sectors, representing emissions proportions of 29.81%, 14.79%, and 9.62%, respectively. Coal remains the primary fuel in central China, accounting for an average of 80.59% of the total CO2 emissions. Industrial processes also played a critical role in determining the CO2 emissions, with an average value of 7.3%. The average CO2 emissions per capita across the 18 cities increased from 6.14 metric tons in 2000 to 15.87 metric tons in 2014, corresponding to a 158.69% expansion. However, the average CO2 emission intensity decreased from 0.8 metric tons/1000 Yuan in 2000 to 0.52 metric tons/1000 Yuan in 2014 with some fluctuations. The changes in and industry contributions of carbon emissions were city specific, and the effects of population and economic development on CO2 emissions varied. Therefore, long-term climate change mitigation strategies should be adjusted for each city. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The research analyzes the relation between buildings with a high potential for final energy reduction and a concentration of low-income, older or empty-nest households. The analysis examines this relation not only on an aggregated city level but also on the level of the city's districts to identify renovation hot spots' in the city. Specific challenges are identified for building renovations in shrinking cities due to a high concentration of possible barriers in the relevant housing stock.

1148,WOS:000304640800004,"Urban forests can play an important role in mitigating the impacts of climate change by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Quantification of carbon (C) storage and sequestration by urban forests is critical for the assessment of the actual and potential role of urban forests in reducing atmospheric CO2. This paper provides a case study of the quantification of C storage and sequestration by urban forests in Shenyang, a heavily industrialized city in northeastern China. The C storage and sequestration were estimated by biomass equations, using field survey data and urban forests data derived from high-resolution QuickBird images. The benefits of C storage and sequestration were estimated by monetary values, as well as the role of urban forests on offsetting C emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The results showed that the urban forests in areas within the third-ring road of Shenyang stored 337,000t C (RMB92.02 million, or $ 13.88 million), with a C sequestration rate of 29,000 t/yr (RMB7.88 million, or $ 1.19 million). The C stored by urban forests equaled to 3.02% of the annual C emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and C sequestration could offset 0.26% of the annual C emissions in Shenyang. In addition, our results indicated that the C storage and sequestration rate varied among urban forest types with different species composition and age structure. These results can be used to help assess the actual and potential role of urban forests in reducing atmospheric CO2 in Shenyang. In addition, they provide insights for decision-makers and the public to better understand the role of urban forests, and make better management plans for urban forests.

1149,WOS:000284759500019,"A 3-D chemistry-transport model has been applied to the Mexico City metropolitan area to investigate the origin of elevated levels of non-fossil (NF) carbonaceous aerosols observed in this highly urbanized region. High time resolution measurements of the fine aerosol concentration and composition, and 12 or 24 h integrated C-14 measurements of aerosol modern carbon have been performed in and near Mexico City during the March 2006 MILAGRO field experiment. The non-fossil carbon fraction (f(NF)), which is lower than the measured modern fraction (f(M)) due to the elevated C-14 in the atmosphere caused by nuclear bomb testing, is estimated from the measured f(M) and the source-dependent information on modern carbon enrichment. The f(NF) contained in PM1 total carbon analyzed by a US team (f(NF)(TC)) ranged from 0.37 to 0.67 at the downtown location, and from 0.50 to 0.86 at the suburban site. Substantially lower values (i.e. 0.24-0.49) were found for PM10 filters downtown by an independent set of measurements (Swiss team), which are inconsistent with the modeled and known differences between the size ranges, suggesting higher than expected uncertainties in the measurement techniques of C-14. An increase in the non-fossil organic carbon (OC) fraction (f(NF)(OC)) by 0.10-0.15 was observed for both sets of filters during periods with enhanced wildfire activity in comparison to periods when fires were suppressed by rain, which is consistent with the wildfire impacts estimated with other methods. Model results show that the relatively high fraction of non-fossil carbon found in Mexico City seems to arise from the combination in about equal proportions of regional biogenic SOA, biomass burning POA and SOA, as well as non-fossil urban POA and SOA. Predicted spatial and temporal variations for f(NF)(OC) are similar to those in the measurements between the urban vs. suburban sites, and high-fire vs. low-fire periods. The absolute modeled values of f(NF)(OC) are consistent with the Swiss dataset but lower than the US dataset. Resolving the C-14 measurement discrepancies is necessary for further progress in model evaluation. The model simulations that included secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from semi-volatile and intermediate volatility (S/IVOC) vapors showed improved closure for the total OA mass compared to simulations which only included SOA from VOCs, providing a more realistic basis to evaluate the f(NF) predictions. f(NF)(OC) urban sources of modern carbon are important in reducing or removing the difference in f(NF) between model and measurements, even though they are often neglected on the interpretation of C-14 datasets. An underprediction of biomass burning POA by the model during some mornings also explains a part of the model-measurement differences. The f(NF) of urban POA and SOA precursors is an important parameter that needs to be better constrained by measurements. Performing faster (<= 3 h) C-14 measurements in future campaigns is critical to further progress in this area.

The GHG emissions associated with construction, operation, ridership and changes in residential density associated with the provision of the new metro rail infrastructure are assessed. These components are then combined and compared to calculate the net GHG impact across the study period, which extends from opening in 2002 through 2011. The GHG payback period is calculated. After nine years of operation, the Sheppard Subway Line is found to have nearly paid back its initial GHG investment in the optimistic case. The payback was due to the calculated mode shift from automobiles and changes in residential density and associated energy savings in the station pedestrian catchment areas. The payback period is very sensitive to the potential for induced demand to backfill the mode shifted automobile kilometres.

Aiming for the long-term goal of zero waste, the City of Madison has been looking into an opportunity to divert its organic waste from its landfill. Previous studies suggested that organic waste diversion could result in a GHG emission reduction; Alternative treatment of organic waste would reduce GHG emissions through avoidance of landfill methane emission, nutrient replacement, and energy recovery when anaerobic digestion technologies are employed. However, organic waste diversion requires modification of collection practices and additions to the collection fleet. This would increase the GHG emissions and there is a need to balance emission reductions and the additional costs associated with a new organic waste diversion program. Collection practices are also important for the success of such a project, as it accounts for 83% of current operational cost for managing organic waste. The GHG emissions were quantified using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The current practice of composting of yard waste and direct disposal of other fractions of organic waste into the landfill were estimated to emit 224 kg CO2-eq./ton of GHG. In contrast with the current practice, four alternatives were assessed in this study: windrow composting, high-solids anaerobic digestion, co-digestion at a large scale industrial waste anaerobic digester facility, and co-digestion at the local wastewater treatment plant. The results show that the co-digestion of source-separated organic waste would achieve the highest GHG emission reduction among the alternatives considered. The results were as follows: 81.5 kg CO(2)(-)eq./ton for windrow composting; -46.0 kg CO2-eq./ton for a high solids anaerobic digester; -156 kg CO2-eq./ton for co-digestion with industrial waste; and -189 kg CO2-eq./ton for co-digestion with sewage sludge. Co-digestion was favored as it shows the highest GHG emission reduction capacity while saving capital cost by almost half. However, the results of the GHG emission analysis were also affected by several factors external to the technologies chosen, including public participation, collection efficiency of organic waste, and types of waste collected. Based on the findings of this work, the party in charge of the organic waste diversion project should seek opportunities to partner with regional anaerobic digestion projects and local utilities, while continuing with its community outreach efforts.

Building energy-dynamic simulations are created in order to compare various external coatings with reference to a social housing case study in a typical Mediterranean climate ( Naples, Italy). An innovative index, the surface factor (SF), is proposed to inform the choice of the most suitable surface coatings as a function of local climatic conditions and thereby reduce overall energy demand. For cities with high solar gain and/or low winter degrees-day (SF > 0.65), high-reflective and/or high-emissive coatings (i.e. 'cool paints') are suitable, while low-reflective and/or low-emissive external coatings are more suitable for cooler climates (SF < 0.4). The simultaneous interactions of wall mass, surface radiative characteristics, and indoor ventilation on the summer cooling energy demands are evaluated and substantial heating or cooling savings can be achieved, particularly for existing buildings.

Simulation users commonly rely on assumptions for certain 'hard-to-measure' building and behaviour inputs, and the range of values use can significantly affect predicted energy consumption. New financing methods in Australia may attach financial risk to this simulation uncertainty. This paper reports on a study examining the sensitivity of total predicted building energy consumption to hard-to-measure simulation inputs for two template Australian office buildings; a 10-storey office tower located in a Central Business District (CBD), and a 3-storey office on the fringe of a CBD. The predicted energy consumption for the archetypes varied by more than 50% from baseline consumption for all Australian capital cities, using high and low assumptions. The input parameters that significantly influence energy consumption were found to be; cooling set-point, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) power density, ICT usage schedule, and lighting power density. A case study of a simple lighting upgrade to a 10-storey office building in Sydney showed that the payback period could vary from 2.4 to 10.3 years depending on the simulation assumptions used.

The process of introducing alternative technologies into, or alongside, centralized urban infrastructures is not a novel phenomenon, as is often assumed. The physical and institutional entrenchment of large technical systems for urban energy, water or sanitation services in industrialized countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did not close the door completely on alternatives. I investigate a number of alternative technologies used in Berlin in the interwar period (1920-1939), in order to reveal the rationales developed around each technology and the ways in which each emerged, disappeared and re-emerged or survived across highly diverse political regimes. The selection of cases is guided by the desire to illustrate three different phenomena of alternative technology diffusion (and exclusion) experienced in Berlin: (1) technologies promoted by early pioneers and discarded by their successors (waste-to-energy), (2) technologies modifying traditional practices that were at odds with modernized systems (wastewater reuse for agriculture) and (3) technologies co-existing alongside the dominant centralized system throughout the 20th century (cogeneration).

For the majority of Indian cities, this means promoting the use of public bus systems. However, the absence of analyses on carbon emissions savings attributable to public bus services in Indian cities creates a significant gap in the literature. This study used recently available data on bus system performance, travel characteristics, and emissions factors to estimate the emissions savings from public bus services in two cities, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. Three types of emissions savings estimates were calculated: past savings from increased ridership in the 5 years from 2005 to 2010, current savings from the newly introduced Janmarg bus rapid transit system in Ahmedabad and the Big10 trunk services in Bangalore, and forecasted savings for 2021 and 2031. All three estimates indicated that public bus services produce significant reductions in carbon emissions. The advantages of investing in bus systems (relatively low cost and quick implementation) over other potential strategies for reducing urban transport emissions suggest that bus systems should be a high priority for both governments and international funding mechanisms for mitigation of climate change.","Prabhu, A, Pai, M",4,Bengaluru; Ahmedabad,IND; IND,10.3141/2317-03,SRID=4326;POINT (77.59369 12.97194); SRID=4326;POINT (72.58727 23.02579),5104047; 3719710,Buses as Low-Carbon Mobility Solutions for Urban India Evidence from Two Cities,2012
1159,WOS:000356374800012,"Quantification of leaks from natural gas (NG) infrastructure is a key step in reducing emissions of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), particularly as NG becomes a larger component of domestic energy supply. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires measurement and reporting of emissions of CH4 from NG transmission, storage, and processing facilities, and the high-flow sampler (or high-volume sampler) is one of the tools approved for this by the EPA. The Bacharach Hi-Flow Sampler (BHFS) is the only commercially available high-flow instrument, and it is also used throughout the NG supply chain for directed inspection and maintenance, emission factor development, and greenhouse gas reduction programs. Here we document failure of the BHFS to transition from a catalytic oxidation sensor used to measure low NG (similar to 5% or less) concentrations to a thermal conductivity sensor for higher concentrations (from similar to 5% to 100%), resulting in underestimation of NG emission rates. Our analysis includes both our own field testing and analysis of data from two other studies (Modrak et al., 2012; City of Fort Worth, 2011). Although this failure is not completely understood, and although we do not know if all BHFS models are similarly affected, sensor transition failure has been observed under one or more of these conditions: (1) Calibration is more than similar to 2 weeks old; (2) firmware is out of date; or (3) the composition of the NG source is less than similar to 91% CH4. The extent to which this issue has affected recent emission studies is uncertain, but the analysis presented here suggests that the problem could be widespread. Furthermore, it is critical that this problem be resolved before the onset of regulations on CH4 emissions from the oil and gas industry, as the BHFS is a popular instrument for these measurements.Implications: An instrument commonly used to measure leaks in natural gas infrastructure has a critical sensor transition failure issue that results in underestimation of leaks, with implications for greenhouse gas emissions estimates as well as safety.","Howard, T, Ferrara, TW, Townsend-Small, A",15,Fort Worth,USA,10.1080/10962247.2015.1025925,SRID=4326;POINT (-97.32084999999999 32.72541),833319,Sensor transition failure in the high flow sampler: Implications for methane emission inventories of natural gas infrastructure,2015

Large variations of the measured variables have been found, and related to variations in emissions sources and meteorological conditions. High values of aerosol absorption and scattering coefficients are obtained during winter and low values are measured during summer. This seasonal pattern in the surface aerosol optical properties is opposite to the seasonal cycle showed by columnar aerosol optical depth. The differences in the seasonal features of the surface and column-integrated data are related to seasonal variations in the aerosol vertical distribution, aerosol sources and boundary layer height. In winter the number density of ""fine"" particles (0.5<particle diameter<1 mu m) is significantly larger than in summer while the number density of ""coarse"" particles (1<particle diameter<20 mu m) is slightly larger during summer and spring than during winter and autumn. The scattering Angstrom exponent, alpha(s), presents an evident seasonal cycle with values of 1.8 +/- 0.2, 1.6 +/- 0.3, 1.3 +/- 0.3 and 1.4 +/- 0.3 in winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively. This suggests the presence of a large fraction of submicron particles at the site, especially during winter. The aerosols measured in this study contain a large fraction of absorbing material as indicated by the average single-scattering albedo that has values of 0.65 +/- 0.07, 0.66 +/- 0.06, 0.70 +/- 0.06 and 0.73 +/- 0.06 in autumn, winter, spring and summer, respectively. The aerosol scattering albedo obtained in the surface boundary layer of Granada is below the critical value of 0.86 that determines the shift from cooling to warming. These results put in evidence the need of efforts to reduce absorbing particles ( black carbon) emissions to avoid the possible warming that would result from the reductions of the cooling aerosols only. The aerosol absorption and scattering coefficients present a clear diurnal pattern, in all seasons, with two local maxima, one early in the morning and the second one in the evening. This diurnal cycle is mainly attributed to the diurnal evolution of atmospheric boundary layer and local anthropogenic activities.","Lyamani, H, Olmo, FJ, Alados-Arboledas, L",80,Granada,ESP,10.5194/acp-10-239-2010,SRID=4326;POINT (-3.60667 37.18817),234325,Physical and optical properties of aerosols over an urban location in Spain: seasonal and diurnal variability,2010

Nevertheless, selecting an EfW strategy for municipal solid waste management is a challenging task not least because of the uncertainty involved in quantifying the potential economic and environmental impacts. This paper analyses five alternatives for managing the municipal solid waste of Sydney for their 'green electricity' and GHG savings potential under conditions of uncertainty. The impact of paper recycling on the ranking of alternatives was investigated, too. Our analysis shows that maximizing EfW generation potential does not result in greater GHG saving. A combination of food and green waste composting, recycling of metals, paper, glass and plastics while only landfilling waste fractions that are not recyclable may result in the best GHG savings.

1168,WOS:000281098300011,"Urbanisation is increasing tremendously in some parts of the world. Consequently, many rural forests may become depleted, although many opportunities exist for urban forests to increase. However, few studies have quantified the carbon (C) sequestration capacities of urban and rural forests in specific climatic zones. The present study compared carbon sequestration in two temperate deciduous forests located in Nagoya and Toyota, central Japan. The Nagoya University forest represented an urban forest, and a site in Toyota represented a rural forest. The urban forest at Nagoya University had comparatively smaller areas of green space and larger areas of buildings and roads. Land uses for building and road, which are typical of urban areas, result in smaller diurnal temperature ranges but higher air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentration. The urban forest in this study exhibited higher gross ecosystem exchange (GEE), especially in the active growing season from May to September, suggesting the possible effect of CO(2) fertilisation. However, higher air temperatures caused comparatively smaller net ecosystem exchange (NEE) because of higher ecosystem respiration (RE). Although both forests functioned as CO(2) sinks at annual time scales, the rural Toyota forest site (5.43 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) had 36% higher net ecosystem production (NEP=-NEE; the negative sign indicates uptake by the forest ecosystem from the atmosphere) than that at the urban forest. The higher normalised respiration (i.e., RE/GPP ratio; GPP=-GEE where GPP represents gross primary production) at the Nagoya University forest might be attributable to factors associated with the degree of urbanisation. Thus, in temperate forests, factors associated with urbanisation may reduce the atmospheric carbon sink function by accelerating respiration. This is an issue of global interest, as many countries are experiencing rapid urbanisation. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

This contribution presents a new method to provide local decision makers with tools to assess the remaining PV potential within their respective communities. It allows highly detailed analyses without having to rely on 3D city models, which are often not available. This is achieved by a combination of publicly available geographical building data and aerial images that are analyzed using image recognition and machine learning approaches. The method also employs sophisticated algorithms for irradiance simulation and power generation that exhibit a higher accuracy than most existing PV potential studies. The method is demonstrated with an application to the city of Freiburg, for which a technical PV electricity generation potential of about 524 GWhia is identified. A validation with a 3D city model shows that the correct roof azimuth can be determined with an accuracy of about 70% and existing solar installations can be detected with an accuracy of about 90%.

1171,WOS:000415769300098,"Heat demand, in buildings is responsible for a large portion of energy loads in Europe, and building renovations represent an important opportunity to achieve sustainability objectives. Efficient district heat (DH) can represent a cost-effective heat source for buildings. Yet, building heat demand reductions will have implications on sustainable DH production and operation. Analysis is therefore needed to identify cost-effective strategies for low-carbon heat solutions in integrated energy systems. This paper proposes a methodology to investigate different scenarios to 2050 involving integrated heat supply and building envelope investment choices in Torino, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden. The goal is to provide an overview of opportunities for decision makers in elaborating heat strategies including DH. Results show that opportunities exist to achieve consistent energy savings and emissions reduction through strategic combination of DH and building renovation investments. A systems approach is essential to avoid unnecessary investments or early retirement of assets: building renovations should be planned carefully as lower DH base loads could lead to increased running costs, and DH investments need to be adapted to long-term building improvements. Reduced peak loads can allow increased use of low-grade heat, higher merit-order power generation and in some instances cost-effective expansion of DH. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1172,WOS:000368604600003,"To examine the use of fresh-air cooling to reduce energy consumption in container data centers (CDCs) regardless of location, a prototype fresh-air-cooled CDC was constructed in a Tokyo suburb, and a yearlong operating test was conducted. Fresh-air cooling of information technology (IT) equipment does not require energy for air conditioning, and can be operated at reduced cost and energy usage. However, the characteristics of fresh-air change throughout the year, which would make it difficult to maintain inside temperature and humidity of a server room at the set points. Also, some geographic locations may be unsuitable for CDCs cooled directly by fresh-air. In addition to fresh-air cooling, CDCs at these locations have been equipped with supplemental air-conditioning units such as air conditioners to control the internal temperature and humidity. To reduce energy usage, it is desirable to use energy conservation methods such as evaporative cooling and waste heat from IT equipment as supplemental air-conditioning because they can be more feasible in compact facilities than conventional air conditioners. Although data centers (DCs) that supplement fresh-air cooling with these air-conditioning methods are currently in operation, it is not clear whether these methods can be applied in any location regardless of the climatic conditions. Depending on the application, in particular, it is necessary to set up CDCs in urban suburbs, because large access latency for users may be required. To examine these issues, a fresh-air-cooled CDC was set up and evaluated for one year in a Tokyo suburb, under different climate conditions of existing fresh-air-cooled DCs. The results confirmed that evaporative cooling and the use of waste heat from IT equipment were sufficient to support direct fresh-air cooling even when the characteristics of fresh air were outside the range of acceptable server settings. Moreover, this CDC realized an annual energy savings of 20.8% compared with the centers that use conventional air conditioning. Furthermore, the power usage effectiveness of this CDC was found to be 1.058 from the energy usage and was compared with that of existing direct fresh-air-cooled DCs which is located in the urban suburbs. The CDC near Tokyo exhibited similar energy savings to other DCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1173,WOS:000364246800021,"Diagnosing and modelling precisely the actual energy consumption at the urban scale is the indispensable starting point of any low-carbon urban energy policy. This paper compares two building heat consumption models for urban scale applications: a statistical model based on 2D-GIS and multiple linear regression, and an engineering model making use of 3D city models and monthly energy balance of standard EN ISO 13790. Both methods are combined in a new multi-scale framework for improved prediction of heat demand and energy savings potential of building stock at the several scales within the city. This multi-scale framework was tested for the case study of Bospolder - Rotterdam (Netherlands) including around 1000 buildings. Firstly, the statistical model predicts the energy consumption of buildings at the city scale, then relevant neighbourhoods for retrofitting plans are selected and precisely modelled using the engineering model, finally individualized energy savings potentials are predicted building by building. The prediction provided by the two models demonstrated a good agreement with measured gas consumption data at the neighbourhood level (5-25% deviation), while errors become higher at disaggregated level. Major differences result from the ability of each model to cope with the lack of information concerning subsequently refurbished buildings, occupants' profile and behaviour, and unoccupied buildings. The study showed the ability and effectiveness of the multi-scale framework to support decision about retrofitting plans at different levels and scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Among building energy efficiency measures, solar shading plays a significant role in reducing building energy consumption, especially in hot summer and cold winter zone of China. This paper carried out a field measurement of shading performance of movable shades installed on the south-facing facade of a residential building in Ningbo city of China. The field tests show that external movable solar shades have a good shading performance that can reduce solar transmittance to about 8% and keep indoor illuminance at about 1000 lux with little fluctuations, indicating a suitable level for indoor environments. A building simulation study on energy, indoor thermal and visual performance of movable solar shades was further carried out. Several important indexes were adopted to give an in-depth analysis, including energy performance, room base temperature, transmitted solar radiation, PMV-PPD and its distribution as well as Discomfort Glare Index (DGI). Results show that movable solar shades used for south-facing windows not only reduce building energy demand by 30.87%, but also improve indoor thermal comfort by 21% in summer as well as reduce dramatically extremely uncomfortable risks by 80.4%, and meanwhile the visual comfort condition is also improved by 19.9%.

It outlines the application of a low temperature geothermal resource as a source of heating for the Challenge Stadium in Perth, Western Australia and the use of ambient temperature groundwater in UK for cooling at the Royal Festival Hall and the Tate Modern Gallery in Central London. Key benefits from the Challenge Stadium project completed in 2004 include reduced consumption of fossil based fuel, cost savings, water supply and water infrastructure development for a local school, enhanced sustainability profile for the sports and recreation facility. The groundwater cooling system at the Royal Festival Hall was commissioned in 2004 and fully operational in 2008 whilst the system at the Tate Modern Gallery is at an advanced stage of development. Sustainable development, specifically economic, planning, architectural and environmental factors, were the key reasons for groundwater being used as a low temperature geothermal sink for the latter projects. For cities situated on geothermal resources or productive aquifer systems, one of the greatest potential benefits from low temperature geothermal applications is the demonstration of sustainability principles, especially reduction of CO2 emissions due to displaced usage of fossil fuels. Projects such as Challenge Geothermal, Royal Festival Hall and Tate Modern Gallery can be legitimately recognised as sustainable as they are ecologically friendly and support locally appropriate technological solutions whilst benefitting the community and economy of the city.","Oldmeadow, E, Marinova, D, Birks, D, Whittall, S, Brown, S",2,Perth,AUS,10.1007/s11269-011-9785-2,SRID=4326;POINT (115.8614 -31.95224),1896548,Low Temperature Geothermal Applications as Enablers of Sustainable Development: Practical Case Studies from Australia and UK,2011
1177,WOS:000295919200023,"Many water scarce regions possess brackish-water resources that can be desalted to provide alternative water supplies. Brackish groundwater desalination by reverse osmosis (RO) is less expensive than seawater systems because of reduced energy and pretreatment requirements and lesser volumes of concentrate that require disposal. Development of brackish groundwater wellfields include the same hydraulic issues that affect conventional freshwater wellfields. Managing well interference and prevention of adverse impacts such as land subsidence are important concerns. RO systems are designed to treat water whose composition falls within a system-specific envelope of salinities and ion concentrations. A fundamental requirement for the design of brackish groundwater RO systems is prediction of the produced water chemistry at both the start of pumping and after 10-20 years of operation. Density-dependent solute-transport modeling is thus an integral component of the design of brackish groundwater RO systems. The accuracy of groundwater models is dependent upon the quality of the hydrogeological data upon which they are based. Key elements of the aquifer characterization are the determination of the three-dimensional distribution of salinity within the aquifer and the evaluation of aquifer heterogeneity with respect to hydraulic conductivity. It is necessary to know from where in a pumped aquifer (or aquifer zone) water is being produced and the contribution of vertical flow to the produced water. Unexpected, excessive vertical migration (up-coning) of waters that are more saline has adversely impacted some RO systems because the salinity of the water delivered to the system exceeded the system design parameters. Improved aquifer characterization is possible using advanced geophysical techniques, which can, in turn, lead to more accurate solute-transport models. Advanced borehole geophysical logs, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, were run as part of the exploratory test well program for a new 66,200 m(3)/d (17.5 million US gal/d, MGD) brackish-water desalination plant for the City of Hialeah, Florida. Salinity and hydraulic conductivity data from the borehole logging program were used for both well design (determination of production zone) and groundwater modeling to optimize the production wellfield layout and predict future water quality.

1178,WOS:000345725400082,"Heat insulation solar glass (HISG), which has been recently developed by Professer Chin-Huai Young in Taiwan is an extraordinary glazing technology for low/zero carbon buildings. HISG differs from traditional glazing technologies with its ability of producing electricity. It also offers some additional features such as thermal insulation, sound insulation, self-cleaning and energy saving. In this work, thermal insulation, power generation and optical performance of HISG are experimentally investigated. Thermal insulation performance of HISG is analysed through standardized co-heating test methodology, and the results are compared with different traditional double glazed window samples. For the power generation and optical performance of HISG, two samples (air filled HISG and Argon filled HISG) are experimentally investigated in real and simulated operating conditions. The results indicate that both configurations show similar performance in terms of power generation. Under a solar intensity of 850 W/m(2), over 40 W electrical power is achieved from HISG samples with a glazing area of 0.66 m(2). Performance of samples under solar simulator is not found to be promising due to the absence of UV and IR parts in the artificial light source. In terms of thermal insulation ability, HISG is also found to be attractive. The average U-value of HISG is determined to be 1.10 W/m(2) K, which is two times better than standard double glazed windows.

This paper started from the architecture design of a carbon emission mobile monitoring system using multiple sets of equipment and collected the corresponding data about traffic flow, meteorological conditions, vehicular carbon emissions and driving characteristics on typical roads in Shanghai and Wuxi, Jiangsu province. Based on these data, the emission model MOVES was calibrated and used with various sensitivity and correlation evaluation indices to analyze the traffic carbon emissions at microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic levels, respectively. The major factors that influence urban traffic carbon emissions were investigated, so that emission factors of CO, CO2 and HC were calculated by taking representative passenger cars as a case study. As a result, the urban traffic carbon emissions were assessed quantitatively, and the total amounts of CO, CO2 and HC emission from passenger cars in Shanghai were estimated as 76.95 kt, 8271.91 kt, and 2.13 kt, respectively. Arterial roads were found as the primary line source, accounting for 50.49% carbon emissions. In additional to the overall major factors identified, the mobile monitoring system and carbon emission quantification method proposed in this study are of rather guiding significance for the further urban low-carbon transportation development.

1180,WOS:000336779000012,"Today, the building sector alone accounts for 40% of the total energy consumption in the European Union (EU). In most EU member states, about 70-90% of the buildings were constructed at least 20 years ago. Due to this, these buildings have a worse energy efficiency behavior than the new ones that comply with current regulations. As a consequence, acting on the existing building stock is needed, developing special methods on assessment and advice in order to reduce the total energy consumption. This article addresses a procedure allowing the classification and characterization of existing buildings facades. It can help researchers to achieve in-depth knowledge of the facades construction and therefore knowing their thermal behavior. Once knowing that, the most appropriate upgrading strategies can be established with the purpose of reducing the energy demand. Furthermore, the classified facade typologies have been verified, complying with current and future Spanish regulations and according to the results obtained, a series of upgrading strategies based on the opaque part and those in the translucent part, have been proposed.

Using a survey of 1525 shoppers conducted in Shenyang, China, this study estimated shopping-related travel CO2 emissions and examined how the built environment and individual socioeconomic characteristics contribute to shopping travel behavior and associated CO2 emissions. We found that, firstly, private car trips generate nearly eight times more carbon emissions than shopping trips using public transport, on average. Second, there was significant spatial autocorrelation with CO2 emissions per trip, and the highest carbon emissions were clustered in the inner suburbs and between the first and second circumferential roads. Third, shopping travel CO2 emissions per trip were negatively correlated with several built environment features including population density, the quantity of public transport stations, road density, and shop density. They were also found to be significantly related to the individual socio-economic characteristics of car ownership, employment status, and education level using a multinomial logistic regression model.

Fiji consists of 332 islands and thus has a predominant and large coastline. Viti Levu is the largest and most important of the islands, harboring Fiji's capital city and most of the major towns concentrated around its coast.

Potential sea level rise was shown graphically as an output to determine where inundation or flooding would take place. This analysis allowed important areas facing risk to be highlighted for future action. Flooding/inundation can be classified into two kinds: 'permanent inundation', which is the result of sea-level rise with tide; and 'temporary flooding', also including occasional storm surge events. The inundated area was displayed under different projections and quantified. The results produced output maps showing the distribution of inundation/flooding around the island of Viti Levu as well as the extent of flooding.

However, highway construction is usually considered destructive to the natural environment due to the deforestation required during construction, as well as subsequent increases in CO2 emissions upon completion of new highways as new traffic is brought to the area. By applying a system dynamics methodology with respect to the Meishin and Shin-Meishin Expressways, this study analyzes two major effects of new highway construction (CO2 absorption and CO2 emissions) as well as the potential influence of felling, replanting, and/or maintaining the surrounding forest area on the overall CO2 absorption capacity, net CO2 emissions, and total CO2 stock in the analyzed construction area. Regarding CO2 absorption, it was found that, if the portion of the forest felled during construction is very old, new highway construction can help to recover the lost CO2 absorption capacity by planting new trees along the highway, even if the area of planting is much smaller than the area of felling trees. As for CO2 emissions, it was found that mitigating traffic congestion and decreasing the required driving distance can reduce CO2 emissions from the highway(s) in question. Therefore, this study concludes that new highway construction does not always harm the environment regarding CO2 pollution, as the harmful impacts commonly associated with highway construction can be mitigated with other technological and/or ecological mitigation methods.

1188,WOS:000366159700016,"This study investigates the development and performance of an innovative approach to the management of transportation, land use, air quality, housing, and a variety of other regional development issues, called blueprinting. Blueprinting refers to a process that brings together planning experts, local political leaders, and ordinary citizens; arms them with current planning ideas about smart growth and data visualization tools, to develop long-range regional development plans. As such, blueprinting represents a recent manifestation of regionalist approaches to environmental policy and planning. Focusing on the Sacramento region, an early adopter of blueprint planning, we use archival data and media sources to reconstruct the development of blueprinting and then we turn to an analysis of the performance of the blueprinting approach in relation to three successive planning efforts. We find that despite the promise of blueprinting, very little progress has been made toward actually changing the regional transportation system and land use patterns. The net result of this long-term planning effort aimed at achieving sustainable transportation land use is that total CO2 emissions increase over time at historical rates.

1189,WOS:000385596000050,"The challenge to mitigate real-world emissions from vehicles calls for powerful in-use compliance supervision. The remote on-board diagnostic (OBD) approach, with wireless data communications, is one of the promising next-generation monitoring methods. We collected second-by-second profiles of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions, driving conditions and engine performance for three conventional diesel and three hybrid diesel buses participating in a remote OBD pilot program in Nanjing, China. Our results showed that the average CO2 emissions for conventional diesel and hybrid diesel buses were 816 83 g km(-1) and 627 54 g km(-1), respectively, under a typical driving pattern. An operating mode binning analysis indicated that CO2 emissions reduction by series-parallel hybrid technology was largely because of the significant benefits of the technology under the modes of low speed and low power demand. However, significantly higher CO2 emissions were observed for conventional diesel buses during rush hours, higher than 1200 g km(-1). The OBD data suggested no improvement in NOX emission reduction for hybrid buses compared with conventional buses; both were approximately 12 g km(-1) because of poor performance of the selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems in the real world. Speed-dependent functions for real-world CO2 and NOX emissions were also constructed. The CO2 emissions of hybrid buses were much less sensitive to the average speed than conventional buses. If the average speed decreased from 20 km h(-1) to 10 km h(-1), the estimated CO2 emission factor for conventional buses would be increased by 34%. Such a change in speed would increase NOX emissions for conventional and hybrid buses by 38% and 56%, respectively. This paper demonstrates the useful features of the remote OBD system and can inform policy makers how to take advantage of these features in monitoring in-use vehicles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Transport represents a quarter of the total amount of greenhouse gases and 36% of energy consumption in Spain. As a consequence, a new law regarding emissions has been approved. Such law regulates the acceptable emission levels of combustion gases for new vehicles sold in any of the European Union Member States. This work deals with parallel-hybrid electric vehicles in order to face the increasing environmental pollution and reduce energy consumption. The present paper shows a modelling of electric and parallel-hybrid electric vehicle using Matlab/Simulink environment which allows us to access different aspects of the vehicle such as engine power, type and size of the battery or weight and to observe how changes can affect the performance and the distance travelled. The model was simulated in order to obtain the electric vehicle's autonomy. Through the use of a Geographic Information System together with a mathematic algorithm based on genetic algorithms the planning of charging stations was obtained, where the installation investment cost was minimized and the geographic distribution was improved in order to increase the quality of the service by improving reliability.

Based on a case study in Beijing, the model includes three subsystems: (1) urban traffic, (2) population and economy, and (3) energy consumption and carbon emissions. First, the model is used to decompose the impact of different vehicles on energy consumption and carbon emissions. Decomposition results show that private cars have the most significant impact on urban traffic's energy consumption and carbon emissions; however, total vehicle kilometers traveled by private cars are the smallest among four trip modes. Then, the model is used to simulate different urban traffic policies. Policies are categorized as follows: (a) driving restrictions on vehicle registration numbers, (b) a scheme for vehicle registrations via a lottery system, and (c) development of public transportation infrastructures. Scenario simulation results show that all those measures can reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.

In this paper, we evaluated Shenzhen's annual carbon budget from 2000 to 2008 by measuring the presence of carbon sinks and carbon sources in the city. First, we used a coefficient approach based on factors such as land-use status and crop yield, to determine the number of carbon sinks in Shenzhen. Second, we identified urban carbon sources such as human respiration, industrial fossil-fuel consumption, cropland soil, livestock and transportation. We used a traffic-prediction tool, namely the four-step model, to determine traffic flow and the average speed of vehicles based on land-use types and the spatial distribution of road networks. Finally, we used the aforementioned methods to estimate the number of carbon sinks and carbon sources in Shenzhen from 2000 to 2008, along with its net carbon source. The results show that the number of carbon sinks decreased and the number of carbon sources increased in Shenzhen between 2000 and 2008. However, the net carbon source per million GDP decreased, which suggests that carbon-reduction efficiency improved during this period. Urban expansion and forest reduction were the major causes of the observed carbon-sink reduction. We identified transportation and industrial fossil-fuel consumption as Shenzhen's main carbon sources. The former produces high concentrations of CO2; the latter is related to the growth of secondary industries. In addition, the spatial distribution of the net carbon source from 2000 to 2008 indicated that Shenzhen's net carbon source increased both spatially and temporally during this period.

This would apply to urban areas such as Belfast which exhibit the classic dispersal of population following deindustrialisation. To realise the potential energy savings, sustainable development policy needs to achieve at least the acquiescence of the consumer.

Certain VOCs are proven to be carcinogenic and toxic, which can affect human health directly and indirectly. In order to develop climate change reduction strategies and to assess the impacts of VOCs on human health, it is crucial to determine the sources of VOCs, which can be emitted from biogenic and anthropogenic sources. The aim of this study was to perform source apportionment using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) analysis on VOC data collected at a regional background location affected by the major sources in the interior of South Africa, which include the western- and eastern Bushveld Igneous Complex, the Johannesburg-Pretoria metropolitan conurbation, the Vaal Triangle, the Mpumalanga Highveld and also a region of anti-cyclonic recirculation of air mass over the interior of South Africa. In addition, a risk assessment study was also performed in view of the major source regions affecting Welgegund in order to quantify the impacts of anthropogenic VOCs measured at Welgegund on human health. Measurements were conducted at the Welgegund measurement station located on a commercial farm approximately 100 km west of Johannesburg for a period of more than two years. PMF analysis revealed ten meaningful factor solutions, of which five factors were associated with biogenic emissions and five with anthropogenic sources. Three of the biogenic factors were characterised by a specific biogenic species, i.e. isoprene, limonene and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO), while the other two biogenic factors comprised mixtures of biogenic species with different tracer species. The temporal factor contribution for the isoprene, limonene and MBO factors correlated relatively well with the seasonal wet pattern. One anthropogenic factor was associated with emissions from a densely populated anthropogenic source region to the east of Welgegund with a large number of industrial activities, while another anthropogenic factor could be related to coal combustion. An anthropogenic factor was also identified that reflected the influence of solvents on atmospheric VOC concentrations, while two anthropogenic factors were determined that indicated the influence of farming activities in close proximity to Welgegund. A lifetime cancer risk- (LCR) and non-cancer hazard ratio (HR) assessment study conducted for VOCs measured at Welgegund in relation to three source regions indicated that the non-cancerous influence of VOCs measured in the source regions is significantly lower compared to the cancerous influence of these species on human health, which raises concern. However, LCR values were within an acceptable range. Factor analysis performed in this paper also identified sources that could be targeted to minimise VOC-related LCRs and HRs e.g. benzene-related cancers can be reduced by targeting incomplete combustion sources and coal combustion.",,0,Johannesburg,ZAF,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.10.047,SRID=4326;POINT (28.04363 -26.20227),2026469,Receptor modelling and risk assessment of volatile organic compounds measured at a regional background site in South Africa,2018

Using Xiamen City as a case study, the future GHG emissions trends from 2015 to 2050 was simulated under three scenarios, namely a business-as-usual scenario (BAU), an emission-controlled scenario (EC), and a reinforced mitigation scenario (RM). Results show that Xiamen City will peak its total GHG emissions in 2039 under EC scenario and 2034 under RM scenario, while there might not be an obvious GHG peak under BAU scenario before 2050. Total CO2 emissions will peak at the same year as the GHG emissions peak year under EC and RM scenarios. Our research also indicates that population and economic growth has a significant impact on the city's CO2 and GHG peak, and Xiamen might reach the CO2 peak later than the national goal due to clean energy supply limitations and continued rapid growth. Lack of favorable conditions for large-scale renewable energy development and relatively high price of natural gas are the main obstacles for CO2 and GHG reduction in Xiamen City.

This analysis quantifies the day-today and embodied energy consumption of four different neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, to examine how built environment variations influence various sources of urban energy consumption. A microsimulation combines models for petroleum use (from driving) and residential and commercial power and natural gas use with rigorously measured building stock and infrastructure materials quantities (to arrive at embodied energy). Results indicate that the more suburban neighborhoods, with mostly detached single-family homes, consume up to 320% more embodied energy, 150% more operational energy, and about 160% more total life-cycle energy (per capita) than a densely developed neighborhoods with mostly low-rise-apartments and duplexes. Across all neighborhoods, operational energy use comprised 83 to 92% of total energy use, and transportation sources (including personal vehicles and transit, plus street, parking structure, and sidewalk infrastructure) made up 44 to 47% of the life-cycle energy demands tallied. Energy elasticity calculations across the neighborhoods suggest that increased population density and reduced residential unit size offer greatest life-cycle energy savings per capita, by reducing both operational demands from driving and home energy use, and from less embodied energy from construction. These results provide measurable metrics for comparing different neighborhood styles and develop a framework to anticipate energy-savings from changes in the built environment versus household energy efficiency.

Kuntze and Calophyllum longifolium (Willd.), were field grown for 3-4 months at an open site near Panama City (9 degrees N), Panama, under plastic films that either transmitted or excluded most solar UV-B radiation. Experiments were designed to test whether leaves developing under bright sunlight with strongly reduced UV-B are capable of acclimating to near-ambient UV-B conditions. Leaves of T panamensis that developed under near-ambient UV-B contained higher amounts of UV-absorbing substances than leaves of seedlings grown under reduced JV-B. Photosynthetic pigment composition, content of alpha-tocopherol, CO2 assimilation, potential photosystem II (PSII) efficiency (evaluated by F-v/F-m ratios) and growth of T panamensis and C. longifolium did not differ between seedlings developed under near-ambient and reduced solar UV-B. When seedlings were transferred from the reduced UV-B treatment to the near-ambient UV-B treatment, a pronounced inhibition of photosynthetic capacity was observed initially in both species. UV-B-mediated inhibition of photosynthetic capacity nearly fully recovered within 1 week of the transfer in C. longifolium, whereas in T panamensis an about 35% reduced capacity of CO2 uptake was maintained. A marked increase in UV-absorbing substances was observed in foliage of transferred T panamensis seedlings. Bothspecies exhibited enhanced mid-day photoinhibition of PSII immediately after being transferred from the reduced UV-B to the near-ambient UV-B treatment. This effect was fully reversible within 1d in T panamensis and within a few days in C. longifolium. The data show that leaves of these tropical tree seedlings, when developing in full-spectrum sunlight, are effectively protected against high solar UV-B radiation. In contrast, leaves developing under conditions of tow UV-B lacked sufficient UV protection.

We included the energy auditing works in three categories: energy restoration of the envelope, of the plant and of both. For each of these categories, we calculated the energy savings. Ultimately, we analysed the environmental benefits of the three different categories in terms of CO2 reduction. This research confirmed that the dynamic method is the best method to achieve a good energy analysis of these complex buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

1206,WOS:000176227600007,"In the present paper, a new system of purpose built landfill (PBLF) has been proposed for the control of methane emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW), by considering all favourable conditions for improved methane generation in tropical climates. Based on certain theoretical considerations multivariate functional models (MFMs) are developed to estimate methane mitigation and energy generating potential of the proposed system. Comparison was made between the existing waste management system and proposed PBLF system. It has been found that the proposed methodology not only controlled methane emissions to the atmosphere but also could yield considerable energy in terms of landfill gas (LFG). Economic feasibility of the proposed system has been tested by comparing unit cost of waste disposal in conventional as well as PBLF systems. In a case study of MSW management in Mumbai (INDIA), it was found that the unit cost of waste disposal with PBLF system is seven times lesser than that of the conventional waste management system. The proposed system showed promising energy generation potential with production of methane worth of Rs. 244 millions/y ($5.2 million/y). Thus, the new waste management methodology could give an adaptable solution for the conflict between development, environmental degradation and natural resources depletion.

In particular, smart parking is a type of smart services used to improve traffic congestion and pollution within cities. Nevertheless, although smart city services are driven by advanced information technologies, their success is highly dependent on user engagement, which is historically problematic. This paper presents and discusses the results of a case study on the smart parking service in London. A questionnaire (involved a total of 212 local drivers) was adopted as the main data collection method. This was complemented by the collection and analysis of 470 online user comments left for the service. The results showed that London's smart parking service may potentially help each driver to save an average of A 68 pound (62.2 l) on petrol annually and reduce CO2 emissions by 238.14 kg per car per year. At city level, a smart parking system could help London save A 183.6 pound million worth of petrol per year and reduce its annual CO2 emissions by 642,978 tons. However, public awareness, actual usage, and user satisfaction of this smart service are currently very low. These present substantial barriers to realise the potential economic and environmental benefits of the service. This paper concluded that further to the very technological efforts, local authorities and service providers need to make a stronger endeavour to enhance public engagement and user satisfaction towards smart services, in order to realise the promises of such solutions.",,0,London,GBR,10.1007/s10257-016-0333-8,SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853),7556900,Impacts of low citizen awareness and usage in smart city services: the case of London's smart parking system,2017
1208,WOS:000392354100017,"The authors studied five major municipalities (Shanghai, Wuhan, Changsha, Chengdu and Chongqing) in China's hot summer and cold winter zone, using eQUEST to perform numerical simulations of the effects of shading by nearby residences on electricity consumption for space cooling and heating. Space cooling demand reductions were as much as 10% to 20%, while space heating demand increases up to 20%. The shading effect from nearby buildings in the targeted region causes reductions in space cooling demand in summer, otherwise this effect outweigh increases in space heating demand in winter, In Shanghai and Wuhan, these two effects counteracted each other, but in Changsha, Chengdu and Chongqing, the effect of increased space heating demand in winter was barely discernible. The negative effect of shading in winter may be disregarded in the three inland municipalities (Changsha, Chengdu and Chongqing), designs may be proposed such that the shading effect from nearby buildings is maximized in summer. In contrast, for Shanghai and Wuhan it is probably more effective to design greater distances between buildings while applying a measure such as planting deciduous trees near the buildings to produce a shading effect from the leaves. Except in Shanghai, the highest reductions can be expected in residential building clusters designed with the suggested minimum distances between buildings. In Wuhan and Changsha, the current recommended minimum distances between buildings are favorable with regard to reducing electricity consumption for air conditioning. The authors extended the target region north and south (Ha'erbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou and Haikou), examined the effects of differences in weather values on the calculation results.

One of the largest open cut lignite mining areas in Europe is in Eastern Germany, south of Leipzig. This paper uses an ecosystem services approach to assess the impacts of mining activity over a 100-year period, spanning pre- and post-mining states. We recorded historical land use data from maps and outlined three future potential land use scenarios based on current planning documents. Our results indicate that maps showing the potentials to provide ecosystem services support the prioritization of preference areas in regional planning. For example, forested and heterogeneous habitats are predicted to enhance future urban development and mitigation of future climate change - a goal of the Saxon government. In contrast, if future development priorities are on local food production and bio-energy use, more arable and grassland areas should be pursued. The use of freely and publicly available data and the simple methods of the approach presented here can be used to inform and improve regional landscape planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is aimed at policy development in terms of energy efficiency and building design as Malaysia has yet to establish any mandatory energy efficiency or energy performance building code. The focus on public low-cost housing projects is important as it is administered by government agencies and provides possible streamlining of proposed energy policies for the housing sector. Presented in this paper are findings from fieldwork conducted to investigate the energy performance and green house gas (GHG) emissions from the building operation of two public low-cost housing projects in Kuala Lumpur. The baseline calculations use UNEP-SBCI's Common Carbon Metric tool to provide project-specific calculations of energy and emissions intensity with its bottom-up approach, while presenting a national-scale projection using its top-down approach. Findings from bottom-up analysis suggest that Malaysian public low-cost housing households consume more than benchmarks set by the World Energy Council and the International Energy Agency, in terms of Building Energy Index (BEI) of kwh/m(2)/year. This is a reflection of the absence of building energy efficiency legislation in Malaysia, both for residential and non-residential buildings.

1212,WOS:000360771800081,"In this study, a robust possibilistic mixed-integer programming (RPMP) method is developed for planning municipal electric power systems (EPS) under uncertainty. RPMP incorporates the concept of robustness within a possibilistic mixed-integer programming framework to handle ambiguous uncertainties in the objective function and constraints. It is superior to existing fuzzy possibilistic programming method by accounting for recourse actions of deviation of objective function with imprecise parameters from its optimal value, as well as economic penalties as corrective measures of possible violation for constraints with imprecise parameters. A RPMP-based electric power system (RPMP-EPS) model is then formulated for planning EPS of the City of Shenzhen, China, while cost-effective and sustainable electricity generation schemes can be achieved through analyzing city's electricity consumption mix, electricity balance condition, as well as energy self-sufficiency. Results demonstrate that (i) power export contracts based on national and regional energy policies bring significant effects on the municipal EPS, particularly in energy supply schemes and electricity consumption mix; (ii) although city can be basically self-sufficient in power supply if nuclear power is not enforced for export, import dependency of fuels remains extremely high, leading to the insecure fuel supply and vulnerable EPS; (iii) uncertainties have significant effects on the city's energy source supply as well as the relevant electricity-generation scheme.

1214,WOS:000379270600034,"This paper explores opportunities for effective policy intervention for residential energy savings in southern China, by analyzing achievable potential of residential energy savings in the city of Xiamen as a case study. In contrast to static technical and economic potential analyses, the achievable potential analysis is based on dynamic energy consumption projections, which consider two real-world factors: (1) gradual ramping-up adoption process of advanced technical measures; and (2) consumers' adoption of these measures. A bottom-up type Residential Energy Consumption (REC) projection model specifically tailored for southern China was developed in this paper, based on the general logic and calculation principles utilized in the U.S. EIA's ""National Energy Modeling System (NEMS),"" and the adoption theory of advanced technical measures proposed by Kastovich. This REC projection model was then used as a policy analysis tool to quantitatively evaluate the impact of various policies on residential energy savings in the case study city of Xiamen. The analysis of the Xiamen case shows that although there is a significant technical potential for residential energy savings in the city (about 20.9-24.9%), the maximum achievable potential (MAP) in 2020 is only about 8.3-8.4% of that year's business-as-usual baseline consumption. Moreover, with existing policies only about one-fourth to half of the calculated MAP is likely to be achieved by 2020. These findings indicate that in order to realize a larger share of achievable potential for residential energy savings in China, additional and more effective polices are needed.

Sufficient back-up capacity is needed in the period when IRE output is low. Bioenergy is both dispatchable and carbon-neutral, and can hence be a promising option to back up IRE. The objective of this study is to explore the potential of urban waste biomass in backing up IRE in an urban electricity system. An urban electricity system model is developed to project future electricity generation configurations. Given the projected electricity generation configuration, the potential demand for bioenergy as back-up capacity is estimated by simulating hourly electricity demand and the supply of IRE for a whole year. The estimated potential demand for bioenergy is then compared with the potential supply of bioenergy from the urban waste stream. We apply our model using data for the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The complementarity of wind and solar energy is found to reduce the demand for back-up capacity from bioenergy.

Broadly applicable to other areas, our systems approach to sustainable water governance overcomes prevailing limitations to research and management by: employing a comprehensive and integrative perspective on water systems; highlighting the activities, intentions, and rules that govern various actors, along with the values and goals driving decisions; and, establishing a holistic set of principles for social ecological system integrity and interconnectivity, resource efficiency and maintenance, livelihood sufficiency and opportunity, civility and democratic governance, intra- and inter-generational equity, and finally, precaution and adaptive capacity.

1220,WOS:000413280100011,"Improved sustainability of cities requires equitably distributed and ecologically safe, if not restorative, infrastructure systems, as well as reduced reliance on resources from beyond urban boundaries. To shape infrastructure systems in a sustainable and equitable manner, knowledge about the sources and demands of the resources they convey is necessary, as well as the technologies which ensure their efficient use and safe return to the environment. This paper undertakes a basic urban metabolism assessment to examine resource consumption in the City of Cape Town. It examines the type and quantity of resources which fuel the city and its people, in order to highlight prospects for the sustainability of Cape Town. Key findings from resource profiles of Cape Town show that annual energy and water consumption, which are feared to be approaching system limits, have actually shown decline in consumption since 2007 and 2011 respectively. The key intervention to reduce energy consumption and resultant carbon emissions lies in reducing low-occupancy private car usage, while the key limitations to reducing raw water abstraction through wastewater reuse is the limited ability to store and redistribute it. Comparing maps of resource access to maps of material stocks shows that while the city periphery experiences low resource access, resource stocks are potentially quite dense. The spatial location of resource stock, flow and consumption represents a useful tool for detailed urban planning and service delivery, and is a gap in need of researching. Although flows of food are difficult to track, estimates suggest that 11.6% of the food processed in Cape Town is grown within municipal boundaries and interventions for keeping nutrients in the system should be explored. Examining the flow of people between suburbs over time shows that migration dynamics are entrenching poverty in already high poverty suburbs, as people with economic means are more likely to move to better serviced suburbs than invest in their current ones. This presents a need for the city to invest in these underserviced areas, so as to retain personal investment. Key recommendations for urban and resource planning are the integrated analysis of resource nexuses using system dynamics modelling, as well as integrating departments within the municipality, to enable more holistic intervention strategies.

In addition, local environmental factors such as built density, green coverage ratio, and land surface temperature were extracted from a combination of GIS and satellite image data sources. By mapping these factors across the Greater London Area, their influence on the risk of heat death during the 2006 heatwave was examined. The model could potentially be utilized to inform urban-scale policies relating to the reduction of CO2 emissions and the identification of heat-vulnerable population groups across London.","Mavrogianni, A, Davies, M, Chalabi, Z, Wilkinson, P, Kolokotroni, M, Milner, J",21,London,GBR,10.1080/09613210903162597,SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853),7556900,Space heating demand and heatwave vulnerability: London domestic stock,2009
1224,WOS:000324719300011,"Environmental sustainability considerations are slowly being integrated into governing criteria and regulations in industrial and urban development worldwide. A ""cradle to grave"" analysis increases understanding the implications of specific design options in the context of creating an environmentally sustainable product, however in commercial real estate the focus is generally on reducing cost, while long term operational and end-of-service considerations remain on a second plane of importance. The balance between initial costs and operational costs (environmental, economic and energetic) is directly reflected in the building energy use which, while requiring a higher initial investment, constitutes the principal driver in reducing the carbon footprint of the dwelling. But constructive measures that decrease operational energy use and thus also decrease operational greenhouse gas emissions require the use of more insulation materials. The embodied energy and GHG emissions associated with the full lifecycle of these additional materials needs to be included in the overall sustainability balance sheet of the development. This study shows that, in the particular case of the residential built environment of Dubai and the prevailing local electric power source generation mechanisms, the environmental sustainability cost of adding the insulation levels required to significantly mitigate transmission losses is small in comparison to the operational GHG emissions saved by their application. However, and in part due to typically short building lifetime and lack of comprehensive waste management strategies, the overall impact of using these materials within the full lifecycle of the Dubai built environment requires special consideration to end-of-service treatment.

Although several studies have analyzed the projections of climate change in Brazil, little attention has been paid to defining the locations that can be most affected, and consequently have a more vulnerable population, in a spatially-explicit form. This study presents a spatial analysis of summarized climate change data and a joint investigation combining these possible climate changes and social vulnerability indicators in Brazil. The Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI), which can synthesize a large number of climate model projections, is used for the climate analysis, and the Socio-Climatic Vulnerability Index (SCVI) is proposed to aggregate local population vulnerabilities to the climate change information. The RCCI results show climatic hotspots emerging in Brazil, covering the western portion of the Northeast (NE), northwestern Minas Gerais state and center-western (CW) and northern regions (N), except northeast Para and Amapa states. The SCVI analysis reveals major socio-climatic hotspots in the NE and several localized hotspots in some of the major Brazilian metropolitan regions, namely Manaus, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and So Paulo. The two novelties of this study are a spatially detailed analysis of the RCCI in Brazil and the development of an index that can summarize the large amount of climate model information available today with social vulnerability indicators. Both indices may be important tools for improving the dialogue between climate and social scientists and for communicating climate change to policymakers in a more synthetic and socially relevant form.","Torres, RR, Lapola, DM, Marengo, JA, Lombardo, MA",16,Salvador; Belo Horizonte; Manaus,BRA; BRA; BRA,10.1007/s10584-012-0461-1,SRID=4326;POINT (-38.51083 -12.97111); SRID=4326;POINT (-43.93778 -19.92083); SRID=4326;POINT (-60.025 -3.10194),2711840; 2373224; 1598210,Socio-climatic hotspots in Brazil,2012

The traditional policy decisions of increasing supply and reducing demand centrally, by building new power plants and/or load shedding, have been insufficient. Locally installed microgrids along with consumer demand response can be suitable decentralized options to augment the centralized grid based systems and plug the demand-supply gap. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) develop a framework to identify the appropriate decentralized energy options for demand supply matching within a community, and, (2) determine which of these options can suitably plug the existing demand-supply gap at varying levels of grid unavailability. A scenario analysis framework is developed to identify and assess the impact of different decentralized energy options at a community level and demonstrated for a typical urban residential community Vijayanagar, Bangalore in India. A combination of LPG based CHP microgrid and proactive demand response by the community is the appropriate option that enables the Vijayanagar community to meet its energy needs 24/7 in a reliable, cost-effective manner.

This concern goes hand in hand with a rediscovery of the central role of cities in the performance of regional and national economies as a whole. But, in a context of radical transformation of production and demand conditions globally, the performance of cities is mediated by their capacity to lead a process of competitive redevelopment. To meet the challenges posed by the changing global competitive climate, the policy agenda of many cities has been drastically reorganized. On the one hand, the search for growth has transformed urban revitalization in one of the main domains of urban intervention. On the other, the new urban policy agenda is singularly framed in a language of competitiveness, improved efficiency, flexibility, entrepreneurship, partnership and collaborative advantage that underwrite the remaking of planning objectives, functions and instruments. In this article, we examine the rise of new urban policies in Bilbao (Spain), a city where two decades of manufacturing decline and economic restructuring are gradually giving way to so-called urban renaissance. During the 1990s, Bilbao has followed on the tracks of other old industrial cities adopting a revitalization strategy focused around large-scale and emblematic redevelopment projects. The article discusses one of these projects, Abandoibarra, a paradigmatic waterfront development that embodies the new logic of urban intervention.

The combination of methods could bridge the implementation gap between scenario-based research and actual policy implementation and thus increase the chances of research being implemented in practise. In the case study, backcasting identifies a need for diverse fuels and vehicles and for immediate policy action. However, analysis of policy integration demonstrates that such action is unlikely given current policy structures. The fundamental lack of integration between energy and transport policy obstructs measures to increase the use of renewable fuels and more energy-efficient vehicles, which in turn obstructs the reduction of CO2 emissions from transport. The combination of backcasting and policy analysis is demonstrated to improve our understanding of the prerequisites for transitioning to a system based on renewable energy, and could thus be useful in further research.

At the municipal scale, we suggest that priorities be placed where there is a gap between adaption need and existing adaptation effort. Taking Seattle, USA, as an example, we present this gap in terms of four categories of adaptation options (no-regret, primary, secondary, and tertiary) for the three primary urban hazards flooding, heat wave, and drought. To do so, we first establish current adaptation need by identifying and categorizing adaptation options. Next, we consider for each option the number of hazards addressed and benefit to and beyond climate adaptation, the projected magnitude of the hazards addressed, the projection's uncertainty, and the required scale and irreversibility of investment. Third, we assessed Seattle's current adaptation efforts by reviewing adaptation plans and related materials. Finally, we identify the distance or ""gap"" as the proportion of adaptation options not identified by existing adaptation plans. For Seattle, we categorized seven options as no-regret adaptation, five as primary, two as secondary, and three as tertiary.

Urban vegetation may provide a cooling ecosystem service, although many knowledge gaps exist in the biophysical and social dynamics of using this service to reduce climate extremes. To better understand patterns of urban vegetated cooling, the potential water requirements to supply these services, and differential access to these services between residential neighborhoods, we evaluated three decades (1970-2000) of land surface characteristics and residential segregation by income in the Phoenix, Arizona, USA metropolitan region. We developed an ecosystem service trade-offs approach to assess the urban heat riskscape, defined as the spatial variation in risk exposure and potential human vulnerability to extreme heat. In this region, vegetation provided nearly a 25 degrees C surface cooling compared to bare soil on low-humidity summer days; the magnitude of this service was strongly coupled to air temperature and vapor pressure deficits. To estimate the water loss associated with land-surface cooling, we applied a surface energy balance model. Our initial estimates suggest 2.7 mm/d of water may be used in supplying cooling ecosystem services in the Phoenix region on a summer day. The availability and corresponding resource use requirements of these ecosystem services had a strongly positive relationship with neighborhood income in the year 2000. However, economic stratification in access to services is a recent development: no vegetation-income relationship was observed in 1970, and a clear trend of increasing correlation was evident through 2000. To alleviate neighborhood inequality in risks from extreme heat through increased vegetation and evaporative cooling, large increases in regional water use would be required. Together, these results suggest the need for a systems evaluation of the benefits, costs, spatial structure, and temporal trajectory for the use of ecosystem services to moderate climate extremes. Increasing vegetation is one strategy for moderating regional climate changes in urban areas and simultaneously providing multiple ecosystem services. However, vegetation has economic, water, and social equity implications that vary dramatically across neighborhoods and need to be managed through informed environmental policies.","Jenerette, GD, Harlan, SL, Stefanov, WL, Martin, CA",122,Phoenix,USA,10.1890/10-1493.1,SRID=4326;POINT (-112.07404 33.44838),1563025,"Ecosystem services and urban heat riskscape moderation: water, green spaces, and social inequality in Phoenix, USA",2011

Heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in residential buildings account for considerable fraction of global energy consumption. The potential contribution the domestic sector can make in reducing energy consumption is recognized worldwide. The driving energy of HVACs depends on the thermal quality of the building envelope (TQBE) and outside temperature. Definitely, building regulations are changing with the time toward reduce the thermal loads of buildings. However, most of the existing residential buildings were built to lower TQBE. For instant, 72% of residential dwellings in the 15-EU were built before 1972. To investigate the impact of warming on driving energy of HVACs of a residential building a computer model was developed. Three climate categories/cities were considered, i.e. Stockholm (cold), Istanbul (mild), and Doha (hot). In each city, two buildings were modeled: one was assumed to be built according to the current local buildings regulations (standard TQBE), while the anther was built to lower TQBE. The simulations were run for present and future (in 2050) outdoor designing conditions. The calculations show that the impact of the warming on annual driving energy of HVACs (reduction or increase) depends very much on the climate category and on the TQBE. Based on the climate and TQBE, the change in annual HVACs energy varies from -7.4% (in cold climate) to 12.7% (in hot climate). In mild climate, it was shown that the warming does not have significant impact on annual HVACs energy. Improving the TQBE can mitigate the impact of the warming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For the most part, in these accounts, the infrastructure networks, their material fabric, everyday practices and political economies, have remained unexamined. In this paper, it is argued that this is a critical omission and an approach is developed for understanding how urban responses to climate change both configure and are configured by infrastructure networks. Central to any such analysis is the conception of how and why (urban) infrastructure networks undergo change. Focusing on urban energy networks and on the case of London, the paper argues for an analysis of the 'urban infrastructure regimes' and 'experiments' through which climate change is governed. It is found that climate change experiments serve as a means through which dominant actors articulate and test new 'low-carbon' logics for urban infrastructure development. It is argued that experiments work by establishing new circuits, configuring actors in new sets of relations and through these means realising the potential for addressing climate change in the city. At the same time, experiments become sites of conflict, a means through which new forms of urban circulation can be confined and marginalised, leaving dominant energy regimes (relatively) intact.","Bulkeley, H, Broto, VC, Maassen, A",43,Davao; London,PHL; GBR,10.1177/0042098013500089,SRID=4326;POINT (125.61278 7.07306); SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853),1212504; 7556900,Low-carbon Transitions and the Reconfiguration of Urban Infrastructure,2014

An important element developed is the nominal residence time of the energy stocks. This value defines how long an energy stock lasts under typical patterns of energy use. The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities.","Bristow, DN, Kennedy, CA",17,Toronto,CAN,10.1111/jiec.12038,SRID=4326;POINT (-79.41630000000001 43.70011),2600000,Urban Metabolism and the Energy Stored in Cities Implications for Resilience,2013
1243,WOS:000209554800014,"Residential heat accounts for a large share of final energy consumption in European countries. Hence it offers a large CO2 savings potential: either through reducing heat demand by energy-efficiency retrofitting of buildings or by substituting CO2 intensive heating fuels. Industrial and commercial waste heat could be one such substitute. Using it for residential heating purposes could postpone or even avoid the costly energy-efficiency refurbishing of the building stock. Urban areas differ in their potential for using waste heat in residential space and water heating, depending not only on supply and demand of heat in the aggregate, but also on the makeup of the building stock, waste heat temperature levels and their spatial distribution. Case studies of real-world neighborhoods will help us understand these relationships. The work presented here offers such a case study for Lokstedt, a rather typical neighborhood in the North German city of Hamburg. Residential heat demand in Lokstedt was estimated based on building age, floor space and volume. The potential of industrial and commercial waste heat supply was estimated with data collection from companies in the neighborhood, combined with waste heat characteristics for different sectors taken from literature. We estimated a heat demand of 12.8 GWh/a for the area and a waste heat potential of 0.47-0.93 GWh/a. The available waste heat could, in theory cover about 5% of residential heat demand, accounting for the heat demand that could be saved within 8 years of refurbishing the building stock at the current rate.

To determine the PAH size distribution, 3-day size-segregated aerosol samples were also collected in December 1999. Concentrations of the 16 PAHs in the PM2.5 particles ranged from 3.9 to 119.9 ng m(-3) with a mean of 24.3 ng m(-3). An exceptionally high concentration of PAHs(similar to 120 ng m(-3)) observed during a haze event in December 1999 was likely influenced more by diesel vehicle exhaust than by gasoline exhaust, as well as air stagnation, as evidenced by the low carbon monoxide/elemental carbon (CO/EC) ratio of 205 found in this study and results reported by previous studies. The total PAHs associated with the size-segregated particles showed unimodal distributions. Compared to the unimodal size distributions of PAHs with modal peaks at < 0.12 mu m measured in highway tunnels in Los Angeles (Venkataraman and Friedlander, 1994), four- to six-ring PAHs in our study had unimodal size distributions, peaking at the larger size range of 0.28-0.53 mu m, suggesting the coagulation of freshly emitted ultrafine particles during transport to the sampling site. Further, the fraction of PAHs associated with coarse particles(> 1.8 mu m) increased as the molecular weight of the PAHs decreased due to volatilization of fine particles followed by condensation onto coarse particles.",,15,Seoul; Los Angeles,KOR; USA,10.1007/s10661-006-9308-4,SRID=4326;POINT (126.9784 37.566); SRID=4326;POINT (-118.24368 34.05223),10349312; 3971883,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in bulk PM2.5 and size-segregated aerosol particle samples measured in an urban environment,2007

1246,WOS:000185677300006,"Research in energy sustainability is gaining renewed priority because of the growing importance of climate-change issues and the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by many countries. Increased energy efficiency and substitution of less carbon-intensive fuels are proposed as the principal means to reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions and associated climate change. The residential sector is an important area for improvement, as it accounts for 22 percent of global energy consumption. This paper illustrates the integration of four dimensions of energy issues within a single community study in Waterloo Region, Canada. First, it overcomes the limitations of single-discipline approaches to energy studies by recognizing the importance of social context in measuring the potential to reduce energy consumption. The 'sociotechnical' potential to reduce residential consumption by 25 percent is lower in our analysis than traditional measures of the technical potential, but is considered more achievable. Second, the paper examines how community-based implementation can enhance the effectiveness of a national energy efficiency program (EnerGuide for Houses, or ECH). Controlled marketing experiments demonstrated higher response rates for materials highlighting local partners. Third, the paper outlines how the local capacity developed by diverse stakeholders (city councils, regional government, federal government agencies, local utilities, local businesses, environmental nongovernmental organizations and the local university) was an important means of overcoming many of the barriers to taking action. Fourth, the paper details the examination of issues of energy efficiency and fuel substitution through a survey of residents' attitudes and comparison to behaviour. For example, stated 'willingness to pay' was compared to the actual sign-up rate for the first introduction of 'green' electricity in the Ontario residential market. The integration of these four dimensions in a single study offers a framework that can be reviewed and adapted to meet the needs of other projects.","Parker, P, Rowlands, IH, Scott, D",9,Ontario,USA,10.1111/1541-0064.00006,SRID=4326;POINT (-117.65089 34.06334),171214,Innovations to reduce residential energy use and carbon emissions: An integrated approach,2003
1247,WOS:000299148900050,"Climate change is a global problem and across the world there are major difficulties being experienced in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies carried out by the authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change, and some possible synergies. Different packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and convergence objectives. CO2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport: CO2 emission levels: Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO2 emissions. The scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a 'strategic conversation' at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and wider initiatives. Aspirations towards equitable target emissions may assist in setting sufficiently demanding targets. Only then is a wider awareness and ownership of potential carbon efficient transport futures likely to take place. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite our knowledge of these domes for over a decade, no study has contemplated their effects on air pollution or health. In fact, all air pollution regulations worldwide assume arbitrarily that such domes have no local health impact, and carbon policy proposals, such as ""cap and trade"", implicitly assume that CO2 impacts are the same regardless of where emissions occur. Here, it is found through data-evaluated numerical modeling with telescoping domains from the globe to the U.S., California, and Los Angeles, that local CO2 emissions in isolation may increase local ozone and particulate matter. Although health impacts of such changes are uncertain, they are of concern, and it is estimated that that local CO2 emissions may increase premature mortality by 50-100 and 300-1000/yr in California and the U.S., respectively. As such, reducing locally emitted CO2 may reduce local air pollution mortality even if CO2 in adjacent regions is not controlled. If correct, this result contradicts the basis for air pollution regulations worldwide, none of which considers controlling local CO2 based on its local health impacts. It also suggests that a ""cap and trade"" policy should consider the location of CO2 emissions, as the underlying assumption of the policy is incorrect.","Jacobson, MZ",48,Los Angeles,USA,10.1021/es903018m,SRID=4326;POINT (-118.24368 34.05223),3971883,Enhancement of Local Air Pollution by Urban CO2 Domes,2010

The milestone of this experimental work was to determine the adsorption and filtration capacities and the physicochemical properties of five commercial activated carbons with a view to determining which activated carbon might replace the open sand filters of the drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) of the city of Salamanca (western Spain). Compliance with the requirements and physicochemical characteristics stipulated in the EN 12915 European standard for the different activated carbons tested was analyzed, and studies of the prewashing and behavior of the carbons operating in the filters were performed. In this sense, filtration tests to study the saturation of the bed, the variations in pressure drop and the performance of the removal of organic matter in suspension were carried out. Furthermore, the optimal time and rate of the countercurrent washing of the filters and the expansion of the filter bed were evaluated. In the adsorption assays, the specific surface area, porosity, useful lifetime and capacity of adsorption of the dissolved organic matter especially humic acids, the major precursors of water chlorination by-products - of the activated carbons were determined. The results not only provided an overview of the actual behavior of different types of commercial activated carbons from their initial installation up to the end of their useful life, but also permitted optimization of the filtration and adsorption processes that could lead to the corresponding economic savings and energy reduction in the use of such activated carbon filter-adsorbers.",,1,Salamanca,ESP,10.2166/ws.2012.078,SRID=4326;POINT (-5.66388 40.96882),155619,A pilot plant study of the processes of filtration and adsorption of drinking water through granular activated carbons: a comparative study,2013

This paper demonstrates how the greenhouse gas effects of waste treatment processes can be described in a simplified manner by considering energy efficiency indicators. For evaluation to be consistent, it is necessary to use reasonable system boundaries and to take the generation of electricity and the use of heat into account. The new European R1 efficiency criterion will lead to the development and implementation of optimized processes/systems with increased energy efficiency which, in turn, will exert an influence on the greenhouse gas effects of waste management in Europe. Promising technologies are: the increase of steam parameters, reduction of in-plant energy consumption, and the combined use of heat and power. Plants in Brescia and Amsterdam are current examples of good performance with highly efficient electricity generation. Other examples of particularly high heat recovery rates are the energy-from-waste (EfW) plants in Malmo and Gothenburg.

This article explores how water managers in Melbourne reacted to the crisis and evaluates the short-and long-term impacts of their decisions. Reduced water demand occurred primarily through residential and industrial water conservation programs, restrictions, together with emergency reductions in the environmental release of water to streams. The city also experimented with using recycled water, in place of surface water, to support agriculture in the Werribee Irrigation District. Water pricing was not strengthened during the drought, and thus not regarded as a drought demand management tool, primarily because Melbourne water companies lacked independent price-setting powers. Today, five years after the end of the Millennium Drought, gains in water conservation appear to be holding steady, but recycled water for irrigation has declined for various reasons. We contend that the Millennium Drought provided Melbourne with the opportunity to develop and implement a more integrated approach to water management. Many of the innovations it forged (e.g., distributed harvesting and use of stormwater) will continue to enhance the city's resilience to drought and reduce its vulnerability to climate variability for years to come.

This article estimates the effects of migration on residential energy use and CO2 emissions quantitatively, basing the probability of being a migrant on the economic, demographic and dwelling characteristics of households. The results of this study indicate that the effects of migration involve reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Urban-to-urban migration is shown to have no statistically significant impact on per capita energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which indicates that population increases through urban-to-urban population growth and natural population growth have no statistically significant differences in this regard. However, rural-to-urban migration is shown to have a significant and negative influence on residential energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Population growth led by rural-to-urban migration produces lower energy consumption estimates than natural population growth. Thus, energy consumption estimates are lower when a city's population increase is caused by rural-to-urban migration than when urban-to-urban migration and natural population growth are the main drivers of population increases.

Cities in the north of England however lead the UK in terms of sustainable, low-carbon, local/district heating, through the implementation of combined-heat-and-power (CHP) facilities; substantial schemes are installed in several cities, including Barnsley and Sheffield. This paper presents the results from extensive experimental and theoretical feasibility studies, in which the merits of these were explored. Barnsley has a number of biomass-fuelled community energy generators, where pollutant monitoring and mathematical modelling were conducted to assess combustion characteristics and overall system performance. Measured pollutant levels were within the relative emission limits, though emission concentrations (CO, CO2, NO and particles) in the flue gas from the coal boiler were higher than the wood pellet boiler. Sheffield already has a citywide district energy network, centred around a sustainably-sourced waste-to-energy facility; an expansion of this scheme was investigated here. This focuses mainly on the link to a 30 MW wood-fired CHP plant, which could be a significant provider of additional thermal capacity (low-grade heat) to an expanded network. Through identifying heat sources and sinks - potential suppliers and end-users - key areas were identified where a connection to the heat network would be feasible.

1261,WOS:000354404600012,"The Mediterranean region is both a global biodiversity hot spot and one of the biomes most strongly affected by human activities. Ecologists and land managers are increasingly required to advise on threats to biodiversity under foreseeable climate change. We used expert surveys to evaluate current understanding and uncertainties regarding climate change impacts on biodiversity in terrestrial, inland freshwater, and marine ecosystems of Israel. Finally, we propose a response strategy toward minimizing these changes. The surveys and the published literature indicated that the main climate change impacts in Israel include ongoing deterioration of freshwater habitats, decline of shrubland and woodland areas, and increased frequency and severity of forest fires. For the Mediterranean Sea, the surveys predict further introduction and establishment of invasive species from the Red Sea, accelerated erosion of coastal rocky habitat, and collapse of coastal rocky platforms. In the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, corals may be resilient to foreseen climate change due to their high tolerance for rising water temperatures. Despite these predictions, science-based knowledge regarding the contribution of management toward minimizing climate change impacts on biodiversity is still lacking. Habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation are presently the primary and immediate threats to natural ecosystems in Israel. Protection of natural ecosystems, including local refugia, must be intensified to maintain existing biodiversity under pressure from mounting urban development and climate change. This protection policy should include ecological corridors to minimize the consequences of fragmentation of existing natural habitats for species survival. A longer-term strategy should mandate connectivity across environmental and climatic gradients to maintain natural resilience by allowing reorganization of natural ecosystems facing climate change.","Sternberg, M, Gabay, O, Angel, D, Barneah, O, Gafny, S, Gasith, A, Grunzweig, JM, Hershkovitz, Y, Israel, A, Milstein, D, Rilov, G, Steinberger, Y, Zohary, T",7,Aqaba,JOR,10.1007/s10113-014-0675-z,SRID=4326;POINT (35.00778 29.52667),95048,Impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Israel: an expert assessment approach,2015

A new dynamic model for a more accurate prediction of pumping costs in wastewater treatment has been developed to overcome this unbalance in the coupled submodels. The model is calibrated using two case studies. The first case study concerns the centrifugal influent pumps (Nijhuis RW1-400 . 525A) of the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Eindhoven (The Netherlands), governed by Waterboard De Dommel. For the second case study, concerning a centrifugal pump (Flygt, type NT3153 . 181) of the intermediate pumping station (pumping primary treated wastewater) of the Mekolalde WWTP, located in Bergara (Guipuzcoa, Spain), a model extension was necessary in order to allow a better description of the pump curve, making the model more generic. Both cases showed good agreement between the model predictions and the measured data of energy consumption. The model is thus far more accurate compared with other approaches to quantify energy consumption, paving the way towards 'global' process optimization and new, improved control strategies for energy reduction at WWTPs.",,1,Eindhoven,NLD,10.2166/wcc.2014.047,SRID=4326;POINT (5.47778 51.44083),209620,Detailed dynamic pumping energy models for optimization and control of wastewater applications,2014

Controlled for car ownership, daily travel time and distance are analysed in both regions. The results indicate that, in the case of Nanjing, the suggestion is that the configurations of current land use which support walking and cycling should be preserved as much as possible and that, in the meanwhile, investments should be made in fast public transport to facilitate economic developments.

This study aims to improve understanding of water cycling in Los Angeles, including the impacts of imported water and water conservation policies. We evaluate the influence of local water restrictions on discharge records for 12 years in the Ballona Creek (urban) and Topanga Creek (natural) watersheds. Results show imported water has significantly altered the timing and volume of streamflow in the urban Ballona watershed, resulting in runoff ratios above one (more streamflow than precipitation). Further analysis comparing pre- vs. during-mandatory water conservation periods shows there is a significant decrease in dry season streamflow during-conservation in Ballona, indicating that prior to conservation efforts, heavy irrigation and other outdoor water use practices were contributing to streamflow. The difference between summer streamflow pre- vs. during-conservation is enough to serve 160,000 customers in Los Angeles.

Usually for these demands fossil fuels are used, however in the last years international energy policies recommended the use of less valuable energy. This paper investigated the possibility to use sewer water as alternative source of heat. Wastewater deriving from buildings is characterized by higher temperature than clean water because inside the buildings 60% of water is heated. The amount of energy that can be obtained from wastewater and the optimal design of heat recovery systems depend on knowledge of the flow rate and the temperature. In this paper the sewer system in Bologna (Italy) is taken as case study. Results of a monitoring period have showed the variability of wastewater flow rate and temperature and their correlation. Data analysis allowed to identify the daily trend for the wastewater flow, whose coefficients in relation to the average flow (where average flow = 1) vary between 0.25 and 1.50, and for the wastewater temperature in which the coefficients ranging from 0.90 to 1.05.

1268,WOS:000346622400083,"Fossil energy burning is one of the most important sources of atmospheric mercury emissions, which poses great threats to both environment and human health. Urban regions are dominant energy consumers; however, the information on the resultant mercury emissions in urban regions has been lacking. Therefore, in light of environmentally extended input-output analysis, this study used Beijing as a case to investigate embodied (direct plus indirect) mercury emissions induced by fossil energy consumption in urban regions. The results show that embodied mercury emissions caused by Beijing's fossil energy consumption amounted to 5.86 tonnes, which is over 1.5 times the direct emissions, indicating that the conventional direct emission accounting method will lead to significant emission leakage. Coal combustion takes the major responsibility for energy-related mercury emissions. As a net importer of embodied mercury emissions, Beijing avoided a considerable amount of mercury emissions. Sectors like construction which play key role in embodied mercury emissions are also identified in this study. To comprehensively reduce mercury emissions from energy consumption the Beijing government should devote efforts to develop clean coal technology and high efficiency mercury removal devices, shift investment from infrastructure construction to tertiary industries and optimize green consumption among the residents, especially the urban residents. The method and findings may be useful for compilation of overall urban mercury emissions inventory as well as have important policy implications for global cities to control mercury emissions.

During the 1980s and 1990s it was considered one of the most eutrophic estuaries in the southeastern United States and sustained dense phytoplankton blooms, bottom water anoxia and hypoxia, toxic outbreaks of the dinoflagellate Pfiesteria, and fish kills. High nutrient loading, especially of phosphorus (P), from municipal and military sewage treatment plants was the principal cause leading to the eutrophic conditions. Nutrient addition bioassay experiments showed that additions of nitrogen (N) but not P consistently yielded significant increases in phytoplankton production relative to controls. During 1998 the City of Jacksonville and the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Lejeune completely upgraded their sewage treatment systems and achieved large improvements in nutrient removal, reducing point source inputs of N and P to the estuary by approximately 57% and 71%, respectively.

1270,WOS:A1997WQ23300009,"Energy consumption of buildings in Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union has typically been reported in very coarse terms, as annual energy use normalized by weather and floor area. Reported figures, based on estimates derived from available energy-delivery data, have shown that Russian residential buildings consume on the order of twice as much primary energy for space-heating as those in some developed Western countries. Reports have been accompanied with qualitative assertions that higher levels of insulation, reduced air infiltration, and better control of heating systems could reduce energy use. However, there has been a dearth of data that first distinguish Russian buildings by construction type and insulation level, and second attempt to quantitatively pinpoint causes for the relatively high energy use. Such data are needed to focus contemporary energy-conservation efforts in Russia on the most promising areas. This paper presents a preliminary set of information that illuminates these areas, concentrating on the city of Moscow. The analysis breaks down Moscow's district-heated apartment building stock by type and year of construction and by the required thermal standards in force at the time of construction. It aggregates these buildings into three classes according to the type of external wall construction - brick or large block, single-layer panel, and three-layer panel - and estimates overall annual energy use for space-heating via a steady-state model. It then compares predicted and measured energy use, for the aggregation and, more accurately, for a single building for which detailed energy-use data are available. In both cases there is a large discrepancy, with actual space-heating energy use exceeding design predictions by at least 60%. Analytical efforts to reconcile the excess energy consumption for the metered building strongly suggest that the most important cause of relatively high space-heating energy use in the building is poor control of heat delivery from the district heating system.","Opitz, MW, Norford, LK, Matrosov, YA, Butovsky, IN",14,Moscow,RUS,10.1016/S0378-7788(96)00995-4,SRID=4326;POINT (37.61556 55.75222),10381222,Energy consumption and conservation in the Russian apartment building stock,1997

This is why climate mitigation targets for energy production have been set, including an increased biomass use requirement.

The objectives of this paper were to assess the net environmental impacts of the co-combustion and changes in urban air quality connected to pellet transport, and to identify environmental hotspots relevant to possible future higher-share co-combustion. The applied methods were screening LCA (life cycle assessment) and fine particle dispersion modelling. The results prove that low-share wood pellet co-combustion in CHP production leads to net environmental impact reductions and does not deteriorate air quality in the urban environment.

The model predicts the impact for currently operating schemes, and also the potential impact of all open loop schemes that have been licensed in central London. It is concluded that there will be thermal interference between these schemes and that in areas with such a high density of ground source energy schemes, the resulting loss of efficiency will mark an effective limit to the energy available for unbalanced ground source cooling. The current unregulated approach to managing the energy resource of the Chalk aquifer beneath London will not be able to sustain the demands implied by the UK roadmap for ground source energy.

This paper selects Tianjin, one of the largest economic centers in northern China, as a study case. An extended stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence, and technology model is conducted to systematically identify the determinant factors driving CO2 emissions in Tianjin during the period 1996-2012. To eliminate multicollinearity problems, partial least squares regression is applied to improve this model. Empirical results show that the rapid process of urbanization has the greatest impact on the increase in carbon emissions, while the industrialization level has the least impact. Affluence level, population size, and FDI also play important roles in CO2 emission growth. The outcome of the FDI-emission nexus supports the pollution haven hypothesis, which shows that the inflow of foreign capital harms the local environment. Improvement in energy intensity is the major inhibitory factor and partially offsets the increase in carbon emissions.

A safe transition to the use of hydrogen by members of the general public requires that the safety issues associated with hydrogen applications have to be investigated and fully understood. In order to assess the risks associated with hydrogen applications, its behaviour in realistic accident scenarios has to be predicted, allowing mitigating measures to be developed where necessary. A key factor in this process is predicting the release, dispersion and combustion of hydrogen in appropriate scenarios. This paper illustrates an application of CFD methods to the simulation of an actual hydrogen explosion. The explosion occurred on 3 March 1983 in a built up area of central Stockholm, Sweden, after the accidental release of approximately 13.5 kg of hydrogen from a rack of 18 interconnected 50 1 industrial pressure vessels (200 bar working pressure) being transported by a delivery truck. Modelling of the source term, dispersion and combustion were undertaken separately using three different numerical tools, due to the differences in physics and scales between the different phenomena. Results from the dispersion calculations together with the official accident report were used to identify a possible ignition source and estimate the time at which ignition could have occurred. Ignition was estimated to occur 10 s after the start of the release, coinciding with the time at which the maximum flammable hydrogen mass and cloud volume were found to occur (4.5 kg and 600 m(3), respectively).","Venetsanos, AG, Huld, T, Adams, P, Bartzis, JG",52,Stockholm,SWE,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2003.05.001,SRID=4326;POINT (18.0649 59.33258),1515017,"Source, dispersion and combustion modelling of an accidental release of hydrogen in an urban environment",2003
1276,WOS:000346954500015,"As a factor associated with urban management and planning, urban development intensity (UDI) could in fact form the basis for a new rationale in coordinating urban sustainable development and reducing CO2 emissions. However, existing literature engaging in the task of quantifying the impacts of urban development intensity on CO2 emissions is limited. Therefore, the goal of this study is to quantify the relationship between urban development intensity and CO2 emissions for a panel made up of the five major cities in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing and Guangzhou) using time series data from 1995 to 2011. Firstly, this study calculated CO2 emissions for the five selected cities and presented a comprehensive index system for the assessment of the level of urban development intensity based on six aspects (land-use intensity, economic intensity, population intensity, infrastructure intensity, public service intensity and eco-environmental intensity) using locally important socioeconomic variables. Panel data analysis was subsequently utilised in order to quantify the relationships between urban development intensity and CO2 emissions. The empirical results of the study indicate that factors such as land-use intensity, economic intensity, population intensity, infrastructure intensity and public service intensity exert a positive influence on CO2 emissions. Further, the estimated coefficients suggest that land-use intensity is the most important factor in relation to CO2 emissions. Conversely, eco-environmental intensity was identified as having a major inhibitory effect on CO2 emission levels. The findings of this study hold important implications for both academics and practitioners, indicating that, on the path towards developing low-carbon cities in China, the effects of urban development intensity must be taken into consideration.

A discussion based on the available literature is supplemented by a survey assessing concerns about water and the quality and usability of climate and hydrologic information available to water managers and communities. The surveys indicate that the central concern for urban residents is the lack of reliable potable water due to frequent service breakdowns-with climate change and variability, specifically drought and high temperatures, as contributing factors. Water managers desire appropriate meteorological and hydrologic information to improve planning strategies, but access to this information remains limited. Considerable disagreement exists about who should pay for previously free or low-cost water and wastewater treatment. Urban users have little incentive to conserve because of the present flat, low rate and frustration with service.

1279,WOS:000410010000007,"In order to examine and compare the efficiency of earth to air heat exchanger (EAHE) systems in hot-arid (Yazd) and cold (Hamadan) climates in Iran a steady state model was developed to evaluate the impact of various parameters including inlet air temperatures, pipe lengths and ground temperatures on the cooling and heating potential of EAHEs in both climates. The results demonstrated the ability of the system to not only improve the average temperature and decrease the temperature fluctuation of the outlet air temperature of EAHE, but also to trigger considerable energy saving. It was found that in both climates, the system is highly utilized for pre-heating, and its usage is unfeasible in certain periods throughout the year. In winter, EAHEs have the potential of increasing the air temperature in the range of 0.2-11.2 degrees C and 0.1-17.2 degrees C for Yazd and Hamadan, respectively. However, in summer, the system decreases the air temperature for the aforementioned cities in the range of 1.3-11.4 degrees C and 5.7-11.1 degrees C, respectively. The system ascertains to be more efficient in the hot-arid climate of Yazd, where it can be used on 294 days of the year, leading to 50.1-63.6% energy saving, when compared to the cold climate of Hamadan, where it can be used on 225 days of the year resulting in a reduction of energy consumption by 24.5-47.9%.

1285,WOS:000392789000090,"In the current study, Urban Equilibrium is defined as the situation where buildings in an urban environment act as a balancing agent for the greenhouse gas emissions of the urban area; therefore the buildings act like carbon pools. Cities contribute significantly to pollution, and the move to more, and larger, cities is increasing. The whole-of-life role of timber in future urban developments as a contributor to balance urban carbon emissions is considered here using a new concept of Urban Equilibrium. When applied to Auckland, New Zealand, as a case study, maximising the use of timber in future urban developments demonstrated that Auckland's target of a 40% carbon emissions reduction by 2040 could be achieved 20% faster than planned while still meeting the city's future growth needs. This strategy is complementary to, and easy to integrate with, other strategies and policies for greenhouse gas mitigation. However, the Urban Equilibrium concept is broader than this and can also be applied in other aspects relating to the sustainability of urban environments. Urban Equilibrium fosters a framework of urban governance that integrates environmental and social development agendas with economic development. This holistic approach takes into account the various effects that economic development can have, and re-defines the concept of growth to include a moral obligation to future generations.

This paper investigates the role that carbon markets could have in facilitating the implementation of composting, anaerobic digestion and biochar production, in the city of Tamale, in the North of Ghana. Through a life cycle assessment of implementation scenarios for lowtech, small scale variants of the above mentioned three technologies, the potential contribution they could give to climate change mitigation was assessed. Furthermore an economic assessment was carried out to study their viability and the impact thereon of accessing carbon markets. It was found that substantial climate benefits can be achieved by avoiding landfilling of organic waste, producing electricity and substituting the use of chemical fertilizer. Biochar production could result in a net carbon sequestration. These technologies were however found not to be economically viable without external subsidies, and access to carbon markets at the considered carbon price of 7 EUR/ton of carbon would not change the situation significantly. Carbon markets could help the realization of the considered composting and anaerobic digestion systems only if the carbon price will rise above 75-84 EUR/t of carbon (respectively for anaerobic digestion and composting). Biochar production could achieve large climate benefits and, if approved as a land based climate mitigation mechanism in carbon markets, it would become economically viable at the lower carbon price of 30 EUR/t of carbon.

The present study aimed to examine the affordability of the Polymeal, and to propose modifications based on economic considerations, and the latest scientific evidence, to achieve consistency with current public health recommendations. Methods: Prices for each food component specified in the Polymeal were obtained from a major and independent supermarket chain in a representative middle socioeconomic demographic region of metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Items included fish (114 g, four times/week), fruits and vegetables (400 g/day), dark chocolate (100 g/day), garlic (2.7 g/day), almonds (68 g/day) and red wine (150 mL/day). Prices were calculated using an average of the major brands, or the most commonly eaten fruits, vegetables or fish. Modifications of the Polymeal were proposed based on published research and public health recommendations since the Polymeal was first proposed. Results: Average price of the Polymeal was AU$11.89 per day falling to AU$8.46 if the cheapest food items were chosen. Modifications to the Polymeal included: consuming fish oil capsules instead of fish, reduction in the quantity of dark chocolate and removal of red wine. These modifications halved the cost of the Polymeal, while choosing the cheapest food items further lowered the cost to AU$3.49 per day.

Four apartments had been monitored during May and June 2009. Three of them are located in Block 126. Two of these apartments face South: 15 and 23 on the SE end, ground and first floor, respectively; 18 faces N on the second floor. Finally apartment, 12 is located in Block 374, on the first floor, faces N and shows a carpentry-closed balcony. The purpose of this work is - to study the evolution of the indoor temperature in each apartment; to analyze energy consumption and comfort conditions; to study energy potential and energy intervention in order to reduce energy consumption: to analyze bioclimatic alternatives feasibility and the possibility to extrapolate results to all blocks. On the basis of the analysis of natural gas historical consumption records, results showed that regarding heating energy consumption during the period May-June, Apartment 12, facing N, with its only bedroom facing NW and its carpentry-closed, transparent glass balcony, presented a mean temperature of 21.2 degrees C, using a halogen heater for 6 h/day between 9 pm and 2 am (0.16 kWh/day/m(2)). Apartment 15, on the SE end, first floor of the block consumed 22.5 kWh/day (0.43 kWh/day/m(2)) (mean temperature = 22.2 degrees C). Apartment 23, located on the second and top floor (on top of Apartment 15) with higher energy loss, consumed 28 kWh/day (0.54 kWh/day/m(2)) (mean temperature = 23.7 degrees C). Apartment 18, also on the second floor and facing N, located in the centre and with its only bedroom facing SE, consumed 18.8 kWh/day (0.48 kWh/day/m(2)) (mean temperature = 22.3 degrees C). Apartment 23, with higher thermal loss through its envelope, but with heat transfer From the apartment located below, is the one that showed the highest level of consumption/m(2). Closing the balcony with carpentry produced an important reduction of energy consumption while reaching comfort conditions. The analysis of the experimental results allowed: (a) to determine through analysis of historical consumption of natural gas prior to the year 2009 that the owner lived under conditions of comfort, (b) to evaluate possible interventions in the building that would lead to saving heating energy. Thermal insulation of roof and envelope appears as the most feasible alternative whereas closing balconies constitute a very good design option in winter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

1289,WOS:000300465800028,"With China's rapid economic development and urbanization process, cities are facing great challenges for tackling anthropogenic climate change. In this paper we present features, trajectories and driving forces for energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from four Chinese mega-cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing) during 1995-2009. First, top-down GHG inventories of these four cities, including direct emissions (scope 1) and emissions from imported electricity (scope 2) are presented. Then, the driving forces for the GHG emission changes are uncovered by adopting a time serial LMDI decomposition analysis. Results indicate that annual GHG emission in these four cities exceeds more than 500 million tons and such an amount is still rapidly growing. GHG emissions are mainly generated from energy use in industrial sector and coal-burning thermal power plants. The growth of GHG emissions in four mega-cities during 1995-2009 is mainly due to economic activity effect, partially offset by improvements in carbon intensity. Besides, the proportion of indirect GHG emission from imported energy use (scope 2) keeps growing, implying that big cities are further dependent on energy/material supplies from neighboring regions. Therefore, a comprehensive consideration on various perspectives is needed so that different stakeholders can better understand their responsibilities on reducing total GHG emissions.

OBJECTIVE To assess the nutritional quality of foods chosen by students and meal participation rates before and after the implementation of new school meal standards authorized through the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This descriptive, longitudinal study examined changes in the nutritional quality of 1 741 630 school meals at 3 middle schools and 3 high schools in an urban school district in Washington state. Seventy two hundred students are enrolled in the district; 54% are eligible for free and reduced-price meals. Student food selection data were collected daily from January 2011 through January 2014 during the 16 months prior to and the 15 months after implementation of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. EXPOSURE The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Nutritional quality was assessed by calculating monthly mean adequacy ratio and energy density of the foods selected by students each day. Six nutrients were included in the mean adequacy ratio calculations: calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, fiber, and protein. Monthly school meal participation was calculated as the mean number of daily meals served divided by student enrollment. Mean monthly values of mean adequacy ratio, energy density, and participation were compared before and after policy implementation. RESULTS After implementation of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, change was associated with significant improvement in the nutritional quality of foods chosen by students, as measured by increased mean adequacy ratio from a mean of 58.7 (range, 49.6-63.1) prior to policy implementation to 75.6 (range, 68.7-81.8) after policy implementation and decreased energy density from a mean of 1.65 (range, 1.53-1.82) to 1.44 (range, 1.29-1.61), respectively. There was negligible difference in student meal participation following implementation of the new meal standards with 47% meal participation (range, 40.4%-49.5%) meal participation prior to the implemented policy and 46% participation (range, 39.1%-48.2%) afterward. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Food policy in the form of improved nutrition standards was associated with the selection of foods that are higher in nutrients that are of importance in adolescence and lower in energy density.

1291,WOS:000325461500007,"The Clean Air Act in the United States identifies diesel-powered motor vehicles, including transit buses, as significant sources of several criteria pollutants that contribute to ground-level ozone formation or smog. The effects of air pollution in urban areas are often more significant due to congestion and can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular health impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been utilized in the literature to compare conventional gasoline-powered passenger cars with various types of electric and hybrid-powered alternatives, however, no similarly detailed studies exist for mass transit buses. LCA results from this study indicate that the use phase, consisting of diesel production/combustion for the conventional bus and electricity generation for the electric bus, dominates most impact categories; however, the effects of battery production are significant for global warming, carcinogens, ozone depletion, and eco-toxicity. There is a clear connection between the mix of power-generation technologies and the preference for the diesel or electric bus. With the existing U.S. average grid, there is a strong preference for the conventional diesel bus over the electric bus when considering global warming impacts alone. Policy makers must consider regional variations in the electricity grid prior to recommending the use of battery electric buses to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

We used a climatic-envelope analysis to predict effects of potential movement of this zone under several scenarios of 1 degreesC and 2 degreesC annual climatic warming. Serious in situ loss of temperate species fitness resulting from northern movement of this zone over the next 100 years was predicted in the upper (i.e., northern) two-thirds of the Florida peninsula under some 1 degreesC and all 2 degreesC types of warming investigated. Replacement of temperate by subtropical species in the upper half of the peninsula during this time period is unlikely because of migrational barriers formed by human-fragmented habitat. A secondary temperate-subtropical transition zone occurs at the southern end of the peninsula. Important losses of cypress (Taxodium distichum [L.] Rich.) from swamp ecosystems are predicted here under some +1 degreesC and all +2 degreesC scenarios. The northern, warming-induced movement of an important group of subtropical coastal species, whose mean northern boundary is presently located near the middle of the peninsula, would be greatly hindered by extensive coastal development on the Atlantic Coast and by the metropolitan areas of Tampa and Sarasota on the Gulf of Mexico. Monitoring of ecologically important woody species for fitness losses expected under warming should be initiated now in order to provide an early warning system. Suggested mitigation efforts for climatic warming include (1) developing an extensive system of connected conservation areas in the upper two-thirds of the peninsula with ""stepping-stone"" migration corridors in or near the Interstate 4 development corridor; (2) minimizing disturbance to cypress forests in the southern peninsula; and (3) planting of mangrove species north of Tamps on the Gulf Coast, together with protection of adjacent inland sites in this area, in case of sea-level rise.","Crumpacker, DW, Box, EO, Hardin, ED",6,Floridablanca; Sarasota; Tampa,COL; USA; USA,,SRID=4326;POINT (-73.08644 7.06222); SRID=4326;POINT (-82.53064999999999 27.33643); SRID=4326;POINT (-82.45843000000001 27.94752),252267; 55118; 369075,"Temperate-subtropical transition areas for native woody plant species in Florida, USA: Present locations, predicted changes under climatic warming, and implications for conservation",2001

This article investigates mitigation policies for transportation emissions in the two most prosperous cities, Wellington and Auckland. Analysing local government policy documents, we dissect commitments and examine the gap between aspirations and outcomes. Neither city's emissions are falling significantly despite trends towards housing intensification, which can cut emissions via shorter journeys. The mode share of motor vehicles in total commuting trips is only gradually diminishing, while the share of walking and cycling is only marginally increasing. We explore possible explanations for the slow progress in achieving aspirations. Our main findings are: first, there is a significant ambition gap between councils' stated goals, on the one hand, and measures adopted by councils, on the other; and second, business as usual' policies of central government are dampening these cities' will and ability to adopt more sustainable policies.

1294,WOS:000340316500009,"Motor vehicles are one of the major sources of air pollution in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The government took various policies to convert the petroleum vehicles on road to run on compressed natural gas (CNG), which allows both air quality improvements and energy security benefits. One of the market friendly policies to encourage the fuel switch was to increase the price differential between CNG and petrol and diesel. This has allowed a wide-scale adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice. However, several years into the policy, there is now a widespread belief among the policymakers that the CNG conversion may have increased car ownership and car travel due to their lower running costs, resulting in more congestion and a reversal of the strategy is on the cards. It is therefore important to test the hypothesis whether CNG conversion had genuinely increased car ownership and car travel in Dhaka city. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey and an econometric intervention analysis to understand the impact of CNG conversion on car ownership and car travel in Dhaka. Attention is also given to disentangle the self-selection and price-induced travel effects of CNG conversion. Results show that ownership did not increase, but travel of on-road vehicles increased due to the CNG policy. However, additional congestion costs are still around one half of the health benefits brought about by the policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims at investigating an optimal land use in urban areas from the viewpoint of reducing energy consumption for transportation. For this purpose, the authors developed two kinds of models. One minimizes the total trip length under the condition of constant congestion. The other minimizes the fuel consumption directly where congestion is taken into account endogenously. The optimal structures calculated numerically illustrate that business areas are located around the center of a city while residential areas are on the suburbs, which is similar to the actual land use observed generally.

This paper gives an overview of the economic and emissions situation in Shenzhen and focuses on the development of the Shenzhen ETS regulatory framework. It is devised as an ETS with an intensity-based cap, output-based allocation and a market for trading of allowances. The design of the Shenzhen ETS attaches great importance to coordinate the dynamic relationships between economic growth, industrial transition and emissions control. The cap and its allocation are determined by carbon intensity reduction targets and economic output, with an aim to slow down emissions growth while mitigating shocks from economic fluctuation and industrial adjustment to market stability. The Shenzhen ETS features extensive coverage consisting of three types of regulated entities and four categories of covered emissions, in order to control carbon emissions by both improving energy efficiency and restraining growing energy demand. A competitive game theory method is created for allocation of free allowances to manufacturing enterprises. Mechanisms for carbon offsets and market stabilization are developed to promote active and orderly trading in the carbon market. Moreover, several challenges and their policy choices are detailed for the development of the Shenzhen ETS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban laboratories are emerging in numerous cities around the world as a strategy for local governments to partner with public and private property owners to reduce carbon emissions, while simultaneously stimulating economic growth. In this article, we use insights from laboratory studies to analyse the notion of urban laboratories as they relate to experimental governance, the carbonization agenda and the transition to low-carbon economies. We present a case study of the Oxford Road corridor in Manchester in the UK that is emerging as a low-carbon urban laboratory, with important policy implications for the city's future. The corridor is a bounded space where a public-private partnership comprised of the City Council, two universities and other large property owners is redeveloping the physical infrastructure and installing monitoring equipment to create a recursive feedback loop intended to facilitate adaptive learning. This low-carbon urban laboratory represents a classic sustainable development formula for coupling environmental protection with economic growth, using innovation and partnership as principal drivers.

Examining the case of a crop-residue densification plant in the city of Jinzhou, China, this study examines the economic feasibility of this plant by analyzing raw material supply, product market, energy policy, and financial reports. The results indicate that these factors, such as the raw material supply, market, and energy policy, favor the development of densified biofuel from crop residues. The typical financial indicators were estimated as being notably positive over a 10-year timeframe, and a sensitivity analysis indicated no threats to project profit stability. These aforementioned analyses suggest that the utilization of crop residues as densified biofuel in China possesses good economic viability.

FFSP is also applied to a case study of Beijing for managing MEPS, and reducing the GHG emission through introducing the EU ETS (European Union greenhouse gas emission trading scheme).

1304,WOS:000366767100010,"There is increasing interest in the potential of cities to contribute to climate mitigation. Multiple assessments have evaluated the scale and composition of urban GHG emissions, while others have evaluated some aspects of urban mitigation potential. However, assessments of mitigation potential tend to be broadly focused, few if any have evaluated urban mitigation potential on a measure-by-measure basis, and fewer still have considered the economic case for investing in these measures. This is a significant knowledge gap as an economic case for action could be critical in building political commitment, strengthening institutional capacities, securing large-scale finance and targeting investment and implementation in cities. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis of the results of five recently completed studies that examined the economic case for investing in low-carbon measures in five cities: Leeds in the UK, Kolkata in India, Lima in Peru, Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Palembang in Indonesia. The results demonstrate that there is a compelling economic case for cities in both developed and developing country contexts to invest, at scale, in cost-effective low-carbon measures. The results suggest that these investments could generate significant reductions (in the range of 15-24% relative to business-as-usual trends) in urban carbon emissions over the next 10 years. Securing these savings would require an average investment of $3.2 billion per city, which if spread over 10 years equates to 0.4-0.9% of city GDP per year. However, the savings generated in the form of reduced energy bills would be equivalent to between 1.7% and 9.5% of annual city-scale GDP, and the average payback period of investments would be approximately 2 years at commercial interest rates. We provisionally estimate that if these findings were replicated and similar investments were made in cities globally, then they could generate reductions equivalent to 10-18% of global energy-related GHG emissions in 2025. While the studies offer some grounds for optimism, they also raise important questions about the barriers to change that prevent these economically attractive options from being exploited and about the scope for mitigation based on the exploitation of only the economically attractive options. We therefore discuss the institutional capacities, policy environments and financing arrangements that need to be developed before even these economically attractive opportunities can be exploited. We also demonstrate that, in rapidly growing cities, the carbon savings from such investments could be quickly overwhelmed - in as little as 7 years - by the impacts of sustained population and economic growth. We conclude by highlighting the need to build capacities that enable the exploitation not only of the economically attractive options in the short term but also of those deeper and more structural changes that are likely to be needed in the longer term.

1305,WOS:000423142700020,"This paper aims to identify how targeted asset transfers help to build adaptive capacity and adaptive actions of the urban extreme poor to climate change phenomena. This paper explores the theoretical debates of community-based adaptation approach and failure of such approach to address urban extreme poor. The empirical evidence of these theoretical debates will be drawn from two informal settlements of Dhaka city, where a targeted asset transfer project has been implementing since 2009. This paper explains that urban extreme poor usually work as unskilled labour and lack different livelihood capitals; and climate change is an increasingly important influence exacerbating an already vulnerable livelihood context. There is growing recognition in the literature that poor urban people and communities are adapting to climate change in physical and behavioural terms. But, in the case of urban extreme poor these adaptation approaches are delivering short-term survival strategies disregarding the notion of wellbeing in the medium to long-term perspectives. It is also evident that community level initiatives structurally reproduce the exclusion of the urban extreme poor. However, poverty literatures acknowledge that poverty-centred approaches could help to reduce vulnerability. As urban extreme poor are significantly more resource constrained, it is reasonable to assert that targeted asset transfers could be a poverty-centred adaptation approach in a changing climate. Targeted asset transfers approaches are the outcomes of recent social protection revolution that especially consider accumulation of physical, financial, human, and social capital in order to build adaptive capacity of the urban extreme poor. This adaptive capacity of the extreme poor may facilitate adjustments in assets, livelihoods, behaviours, and technologies in order to reduce future climate vulnerability. In this context, this paper seeks to answer whether targeted asset transfer approaches can be considered as effective poverty-centred adaptation approaches for the urban extreme poor or not.",,0,Dhaka,BGD,10.1007/s10668-016-9888-2,SRID=4326;POINT (90.40743999999999 23.7104),10356500,Adaptation to climate change as resilience for urban extreme poor: lessons learned from targeted asset transfers programmes in Dhaka city of Bangladesh,2018
1306,WOS:000385318700065,"Within residential electricity consumption there exists significant variability from home-to-home due to the differences in building thermal properties, appliances, and inhabitants. Electricity analyses at sub city scales using predefined geographies, such census tracts, might artificially split areas with homogenous characteristics leading to analyses that don't effectively contrast the drivers of energy use. The objective of this study is to use the spatial relationships between demographics, building types, and electricity consumption to form new geographies with less variability for use in residential energy assessment. Using Los Angeles and New York City as case studies, differences in energy use variability within predefined geographies (e.g., census tract) are compared to geographies defined by clustering on socio-technical characteristics. Socio-technical clustering, regardless of the chosen subset of variables, reduces the energy consumption variability over pre-defined geopolitical boundaries with high statistical significance (p << 0.0001). By clustering, intra-regional variability is reduced by 13% in Los Angeles and 29% in New York, therefore improving opportunities for prediction and forecasting. This is the first study to examine the role of spatial boundaries in urban energy assessment. The creation of socio-technical geographies for electricity assessment creates opportunities for improving predictions and forecasts for future sub-and cross-city energy studies.

The consequences of climate change have prompted progressive governments such as British Columbia to establish legislative GHG emission reductions targets, which have lead to energy conscience municipalities within the province voluntarily committing to helping achieve such targets. Best practices examined from European municipalities share a common theme of renewable energy adoption and municipally-owned utilities. An emerging renewable energy technology are tidal current turbines (MI's), which function to extract kinetic energy from the lateral movement of the tides in areas with considerable tidal velocities. This paper examines the history, physics, operational parameters, and plausible environmental impacts of TCTs in order to make a case for their sustainable implementation. The feasibility of the municipalities of North Pender Island, South Pender Island, and Saturna of the Southern Gulf Islands Region (SGIR), British Columbia, to help meet established GHG emissions reduction targets through the implementation of TCTs is analyzed, demonstrating that the deployment of 10 TCTs can produce 38,266,602 kWh/yr of electricity, mitigating 1138 t of CO2e, achieving 9.9% of the cumulative municipal GHG emissions mitigation targets. The paper then examines a case study in the Shetland Islands and Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters, Scotland, suggesting that jurisdictional regulatory powers over TCT installation and operation be devolved from the British Columbia government to the municipal governments of North Pender Island, South Pender Island, and Saturna, so that such communities can reap the benefits associated with a municipally-owned utility.","Sangiuliano, SJ",1,Best,NLD,10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.036,SRID=4326;POINT (5.39028 51.5075),29074,"Community energy and emissions planning for tidal current turbines: A case study of the municipalities of the Southern Gulf Islands Region, British Columbia",2017

Industrial symbiosis (IS) provides a system innovation to utilize the industry to fight climate change and pursue sustainable urban development, while few attentions are paid in literatures. Under this circumstance, this study reviews the low-carbon city practice in China and conducts a case study to calculate the CO2 emissions reduction potential under promoting IS projects in two cities of China, named Jinan and Liuzhou. With the real national project in Jinan as advanced example, new scenarios related to IS are designed for Liuzhou, including comprehensive energy network, waste plastics recycling, scrap tires recycling and flying ash recycling. The material/waste and energy exchange is quantified in the IS network, as well as the related environmental benefit.

An important concern addressed is the inefficiency of present fuel usage in the UK - namely large-scale, fossil-fuelled power stations and energy-from-waste plants that discharge huge quantities of low-grade heat to the atmosphere. Other countries recover this thermal energy and use it to supply heating and hot water to nearby domestic, commercial and industrial buildings. Such district heating schemes can provide cost-effective and low-carbon energy to local populations. Although the amount of district heating in the UK is small, Sheffield currently has an award-winning city-wide district energy network that incorporates a combined-heat-and-power energy-from-waste facility, providing electricity and district heating; this scheme is explored herein, with the purpose of identifying potential expansions through heat mapping.

Graziers had carried out extensive clearing of the original trees since the 1820s leaving only scattered remnants and some plantings near homesteads. With the selection of Canberra as the site for the new capital of Australia, extensive tree plantings began in 1911. These trees have delivered a number of benefits, including aesthetic values and the amelioration of climatic extremes. Recently, however, it was considered that the benefits might extend to pollution mitigation and the sequestration of carbon. This paper outlines a case study of the value of the Canberra urban forest with particular reference to pollution mitigation. This study uses a tree inventory, modelling and decision support system developed to collect and use data about trees for tree asset management. The decision support system (DISMUT) was developed to assist in the management of about 400,000 trees planted in Canberra. The size of trees during the 5-year Kyoto Commitment Period was estimated using DISMUT and multiplied by estimates of value per square meter of canopy derived from available literature. The planted trees are estimated to have a combined energy reduction, pollution mitigation and carbon sequestration value of US$20-67 million during the period 2008-2012.

However, the planting and maintenance of urban trees come at a cost. We estimate the discounted cost of net carbon reductions associated with planting and caring for street trees in New York City (NYC) over 50-and 100-year horizons. Depending on the species planted, the cost of reducing carbon, averaged across planting locations, ranges from $3133 to $8888 per tonne carbon (tC), which is higher than current cost estimates of forest-based carbon sequestration. The London plane tree is the most cost-effective species because of its long life span and large canopy, and the marginal cost of carbon reduction for the species ranges from $1553 to $7396/tC across planting locations.

Research has shown that changing travel behavior is one of the most effective methods in reducing the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in transportation. Cycling in particular, is gaining more attention as a non-automobile alternative mode of transportation. A number of studies have been conducted that examined the impact of various factors such as demographic characteristics on cycling behavior. However, cycling behavior is perceived to be dependent on weather conditions as well. This study focuses on cycling in cold weather and aims to develop an understanding of characteristics of cyclists and their cycling behavior in cold temperatures. An intercept survey is conducted among cyclist on a newly implemented bike lane under close-to-freezing temperatures in Calgary, Canada. The results of the survey provide a baseline for understanding the characteristics of winter cycling. Cross-tabulated analysis of the data identified a number of statistically significant relationships between different variables.

A series of national and local policies have been implemented for achieving the co-benefits of reducing emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollution for China's sustainable development. In this paper, the achievement of climate change mitigation and air pollution reduction in different sectors through implementing policies is reviewed. This paper reports on the types of policy measures that have been introduced in two cases (i.e. Tiexi District of Shenyang and Baoshan District of Shanghai) to affect air quality and energy efficiency improvements, which are then collectively examined in terms of their impacts on GHG and air pollutant emissions. Recommendations are made for achieving co-benefits effectively through the integrated approach by comprehensively concentrating on the short and longterm environmental protection and energy conservation at local and national levels based on the analysis made in the paper. The limited coordination and lack of capacity in different government bodies may be the main barriers to the implementation of a co-benefits approach. Enhancing the cooperation and capacity building could overcome these obstacles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For policy-makers to adequately meet the challenges brought about by changes in the dynamics of urban areas, it is important to clearly identify and communicate their causes. Floods in Douala (the most densely populated city in the central African sub-region), are being associated chiefly with changing rainfall patterns, resulting from climate change in major policy circles. We investigate this contention using statistical analysis of daily rainfall time-series data covering the period 1951-2008, and tools of geographic information systems. Using attributes such as rainfall anomalies, trends in the rainfall time series, daily rainfall maxima and rainfall intensity-duration-frequency, we find no explanation for the attribution of an increase in the occurrences and severity of floods to changing rainfall patterns. The culprit seems to be the massive increase in the population of Douala, in association with poor planning and investment in the city's infrastructure. These demographic changes and poor planning have occurred within a physical geography setting that is conducive for the inducement of floods. Failed urban planning in Cameroon since independence set the city up for a flood-prone land colonization. This today translates to a situation in which large portions of the city's surface area and the populations they harbor are vulnerable to the city's habitual annual floods. While climate change stands to render the city even more vulnerable to floods, there is no evidence that current floods can be attributed to the changes in patterns of rainfall being reported in policy and news domains.",,0,Douala,CMR,10.1080/09640568.2016.1149048,SRID=4326;POINT (9.704280000000001 4.04827),1338082,"Floods in the Douala metropolis, Cameroon: attribution to changes in rainfall characteristics or planning failures?",2017

The reduction of environmental impacts in the cement industry has gained increasing concern worldwide for environmental sustainability. As a resource-scarce city, cement production in Hong Kong is associated with high CO2 emissions, thus contributing significantly to the high environmental impacts in the construction industry. This study herein has been conducted to comprehensively assess the energy consumption and global warming potential impacts of different types of cement manufactured in Hong Kong using life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques. Two sustainable strategies for the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gases emission in the cement industry were then proposed. The LCA results showed that ordinary Portland cement production has high environmental impacts mainly clue to the import of associated raw materials and burning of fossil fuel. The use of alternative material, such as fly ash would help to reduce the environmental impacts. Significant impacts reductions associated with cement production can be further achieved by strategies such as the use of glass powder from locally generated waste glass bottles as part of the raw materials, and the use of a bio-fuel produced from locally generated wood wastes as a co-fuel with coal. The assessment results indicated that about 12% of the total greenhouse gases emission and 15% of energy consumption can be reduced from the cement industry in Hong Kong by using waste materials to replace virgin materials (clinker/coal).

Taking Chongqing as a representative case in inland China, we proposed an analysis framework to evaluate the socioeconomic transition effects on CO2 emissions during the period 1997-2012. Based on the framework, we found that the industrialization process, with its rapid expansion of construction and heavy manufacturing industries, had a strong impact on the structure of CO2 emissions growth. Meanwhile, the development of transport equipment manufacturing and high-tech industry contributed to low-carbon development. The framework further showed that the urbanization process contributed to the increased CO2 emissions mainly by intensive investments in the construction sector and changing urban household consumption. Particularly, the fast-growing urban population, the urban household consumption level, as well as the associated consumption pattern transition towards a growing demand for manufacturing products, transport, shelter, and services together lead to tripled urban household consumption related CO2 emissions. These empirical results suggest that a targeted CO2 mitigation policy in Chongqing should focus on multiple significant socioeconomic driving factors with diverse leading sectors. This implication should be applicable for other inland regions with similar geographical and socioeconomic features. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1321,WOS:000399511800027,"Global urbanisation will put considerable stress on both water and energy resources. While there is much research at the national and regional levels on the energy implications of water supply (the urban water-energy 'nexus'), there is relatively little at the city scale. This literature is further diminished when attempting to account for the climate impact of urban water systems. A study of the urban water-energy-climate nexus is presented for Mexico City. It is shown that 50% of Mexico City water comes from a local aquifer with a further 30% deriving from energy-intensive surface sources which are pumped over considerable topography. The water supply system consumes 90% of the water system energy demand, and is responsible for the majority (90%) of the CO(2)e emissions. In the wastewater sector, 80-90% is discharged with no or little treatment, with correspondingly low energy demand. The small fraction that is treated accounts for the majority of energy use in the wastewater sector. This study shows the uncertainty in energy demand and CO(2)e emissions when reliant on secondary data which considerably over/under-estimate energy use compared with primary data. This has implications when assessing energy and carbon budgets. Three water savings options are assessed for their impact on energy and CO(2)e emissions reductions. Considerable reductions in water supply volumes and concomitant energy consumption and CO(2)e emissions are possible. However the extent of implementation, and the effectiveness of any implemented solutions depend on financing, institutional backing and public support. An additional measure to reduce the climate impact is to switch from traditional to renewable fuels. This work adds city-level quantification of the urban water-energy-climate nexus, allowing policy makers to discern which water-system elements are responsible for the greatest energy use and climate impact, and are better equipped to make targeted operational decisions.

Following Kojeve's reading of contradiction in Hegel's oeuvre, I argue that contradiction is a constitutive feature of low carbon interventions. This is an alternative to conventional readings of contradiction as a provisional encounter of opposites in which one will eventually cancel out the other. I unpack the concept of contradiction in three ways: first, by displaying a Hegelian-inspired understanding of contradiction in relation to change, time, and desire; second, by explaining how inherent contradictions can also be read in relation to the excesses that characterize the deployment of methods of calculation in low carbon interventions; and third, by situating these contradictions within the overall dynamics of carbon governance and purposive attempts to bring about a low carbon transition. The paper explores the practical implications of this analysis in a case of low carbon interventions in social housing in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The case study shows that, if contradictions are at the heart of low carbon interventions, contradiction analysis may provide a direction towards broader reconfigurations of social and technological practices and generate a desire to change.","Broto, VC",3,Ljubljana,SVN,10.1177/0263775815594297,SRID=4326;POINT (14.50513 46.05108),272220,"Contradiction, intervention, and urban low carbon transitions",2015

The control COAMPS simulations use the single-layer Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Urban Canopy Model (W-UCM) and sensitivity simulations use a multilayer urban parameterization based on Brown and Williams (BW-UCM). Both simulations use surface forcing from the WRF land surface model, Noah, and hourly sea surface temperature fields from the New York Harbor and Ocean Prediction System model hindcast. Mean statistics are computed for the 23-day period from 5 to 27 August (540-hourly observations) at five Meteorological Aviation Report stations for a nested 0.444-km horizontal resolution grid centered over the NYC metropolitan area. Both simulations show a cold mean urban canopy air temperature bias primarily due to an underestimation of nighttime temperatures. The mean bias is significantly reduced using the W-UCM (-0.10 degrees C for W-UCM versus -0.82 degrees C for BW-UCM) due to the development of a stronger nocturnal urban heat island (UHI; mean value of 2.2 degrees C for the W-UCM versus 1.9 degrees C for the BW-UCM). Results from a 24-h case study (12 August 2005) indicate that the W-UCM parameterization better maintains the UHI through increased nocturnal warming due to wall and road effects. The ground heat flux for the W-UCM is much larger during the daytime than for the BW-UCM (peak similar to 300 versus 100 W m(-2)), effectively shifting the period of positive sensible flux later into the early evening. This helps to maintain the near-surface mixed layer at night in the W-UCM simulation and sustains the nocturnal UHI. In contrast, the BW-UCM simulation develops a strong nocturnal stable surface layer extending to approximately 50-75-m depth. Subsequently, the nocturnal BW-UCM wind speeds are a factor of 3-4 less than W-UCM with reduced nighttime turbulent kinetic energy (average < 0.1 m(2) s(-2)). For the densely urbanized area of Manhattan, BW-UCM winds show more dependence on urbanization than W-UCM. The decrease in urban wind speed is most prominent for BW-UCM both in the day- and nighttime over lower Manhattan, with the daytime decrease generally over the region of tallest building heights while the nighttime decrease is influenced by both building height as well as urban fraction. In contrast, the W-UCM winds show less horizontal variation over Manhattan, particularly during the daytime.

This study focuses on addressing the impact of climate change, economic and population growth. This study investigates the sensitivity of regional cooling energy consumption to several key parameters: air temperature, number of households, cooling-system penetration rate, energy efficiency of air conditioners and ceiling insulation. The results show that the four major cities (Brisbane, Gold Coast, Moreton Bay and Sunshine Coast) will constitute 73% of the total SEQ residential cooling energy in 2030 in comparison with their share of 77% in 2005. Due to the anticipated strong growth in the number of households, Ipswich and Scenic Rim will have an energy use increase of 145% and 124%, respectively, for the 25-year period.

1333,WOS:000284355400017,"Understanding of solids deposition, erosion, and transport processes in sewer systems has improved considerably in the past decade. This has provided guidance for controlling sewer solids and associated acute pollutants to protect the environment and improve the operation of wastewater systems. Although measures to decrease combined sewer overflow (CSO) events have reduced the amount of discharged pollution, overflows continue to occur during rainy weather in combined sewer systems. The solution lies in the amount of water allotted to various processes in an effluent treatment system, in impact evaluation of water quality and prediction technology, and in stressing the importance of developing a control technology. Extremely contaminated inflow has been a serious research subject, especially in connection with the influence of rainy weather on nitrogen and organic matter removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). An intensive investigation of an extremely polluted inflow load to WWTP during rainy weather was conducted in the city of Matsuyama, the region used for the present research on total suspended solid (TSS) concentration. Since the inflow during rainy weather can be as much as 400 times that in dry weather, almost all sewers are unsettled and overflowing when a rain event is more than moderate. Another concern is the energy consumed by wastewater treatment; this problem has become important from the viewpoint of reducing CO2 emissions and overall costs. Therefore, while establishing a prediction technology for the inflow water quality characteristics of a sewage disposal plant is an important priority, the development of a management/control method for an effluent treatment system that minimises energy consumption and CO2 emissions due to water disposal is also a pressing research topic with regards to the quality of treated water. The procedure to improve water quality must make use of not only water quality and biotic criteria, but also modelling systems to enable the user to link the effect of changes in urban sewage systems with specific quality, energy consumption, CO2 emission, and ecological improvements of the receiving water.","Mouri, G, Oki, T",3,Matsuyama,JPN,10.2166/wst.2010.249,SRID=4326;POINT (132.76574 33.83916),443322,"Modelling sewer sediment deposition, erosion, and transport processes to predict acute influent and reduce combined sewer overflows and CO2 emissions",2010
1334,WOS:000407655400027,"In this study, a two-stage type-2 fuzzy stochastic programming (TTSP) method is developed for supporting clean production of energy systems with carbon and pollutant mitigation under uncertainty. TTSP can handle multiple uncertainties expressed as type-2 fuzzy sets, random variables and interval values; it can also provide an effective linkage between the pre-regulated energy and environmental policies as well as the associated economic implication. The TTSP method is then applied to planning energy system of Shanghai through introducing carbon emission trading (CET) and green certificate (GC) schemes. The solutions obtained can help generate energy-supply and electricity-generation schemes under different carbon trading ratios and various development plans of renewable energy. Results reveal that (i) the city's future energy structure would transit to the clean-production pattern on the basis of CET and GC policies; (ii) replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources (i.e. wind and photovoltaic power) can effectively facilitate reducing the emissions of pollutants (e.g., SO2, NOx and PM) and greenhouse gas (e.g., CO2). The results can help decision makers adjust energy and electricity supply, make appropriate mitigation plan, as well as gain insight into the relationship between mitigation schemes and optimal clean-production pattern.

1335,WOS:000372379700006,"Despite growing interest in China's response to climate change and energy security, studies undertaken at the subnational level are rare. In the context of the multilevel governance paradigm, this article examines the governance of climate change and energy policy in Shanghai, a rapidly growing Chinese megacity highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although the energy and carbon intensity of Shanghai's economy have fallen significantly since China launched its economic reforms, overall carbon emissions in the municipality continue to rise. Through examining the Shanghai case, this article argues that Chinese subnational climate mitigation policy is dominated by hierarchical governance arrangements. Nevertheless, shifts in national climate and energy policy since 2007 have mandated provincial-level governments, including Shanghai, to develop their own climate and energy policies while offering greater local autonomy for incorporating climate and energy issues into development goals: is this attributable to a decentred form of multilevel governance? The article concludes that Shanghai's climate mitigation and energy policy is dominated by hierarchical governance whereby policies are 'downloaded' from the central government.

1337,WOS:000403534500001,"To effectively address climate change, aggressive mitigation policies need to be implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Anthropogenic carbon emissions are mostly generated from urban - environments, where human activities are spatially concentrated. Improvements in uncertainty determinations and precision of measurement techniques are critical to permit accurate and precise tracking of emissions changes relative to the reduction targets. As part of the INFLUX project, we quantified carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) emission rates for the city of Indianapolis by averaging results from nine aircraft-based mass balance experiments performed in November-December 2014. Our goal was to assess the achievable precision of the aircraft-based mass balance method through averaging, assuming constant CO2, CH4 and CO emissions during a three-week field campaign in late fall. The averaging method leads to an emission rate of 14,600 mol/s for CO2, assumed to be largely fossil-derived for this period of the year, and 108 mol/s for CO. The relative standard error of the mean is 17% and 16%, for CO2 and CO, respectively, at the 95% confidence level (CL), i.e. a more than 2-fold improvement from the previous estimate of similar to 40% for single-flight measurements for Indianapolis. For CH4, the -averaged emission rate is 67 mol/s, while the standard error of the mean at 95% CL is large, i.e. +/- 60%. Given the results for CO2 and CO for the same flight data, we conclude that this much larger scatter in the observed CH4 emission rate is most likely due to variability of CH4 emissions, suggesting that the assumption of constant daily emissions is not correct for CH4 sources. This work shows that repeated measurements using aircraft-based mass balance methods can yield sufficient precision of the mean to inform emissions reduction efforts by detecting changes over time in urban emissions.",,3,Indianapolis,USA,10.1525/elementa.134,SRID=4326;POINT (-86.15804 39.76838),829718,Assessing the optimized precision of the aircraft mass balance method for measurement of urban greenhouse gas emission rates through averaging,2017

Studies from North America and Asia have reported that urban trees can be used to mitigate these emissions. However, little is known about the role of European urban streetscapes in mitigating similar emissions from the transportation sector. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a method to calculate carbon dioxide storage and sequestration at the streetscapes level using field data, an existing tree inventory and available region-specific allometric equations. Results were compared to annual vehicular CO2 emissions from a city in the Italian Alps to determine the CO2 offset potential of urban streetscapes. We found that the trees in Bolzano's streetscapes through sequestration annually offset 0.08% of the amount of CO2 emitted by the transportation sector. Results, applications, and a potential indicator are discussed and compared against other studies.

Aerosol DRF in India is usually reported for external mixing and any deviation from this would lead to high bias and error. Limited information on aerosol composition hinders in resolving this issue in India. Here we use two years of aerosol chemical composition data measured at megacity Delhi to examine the most probable aerosol mixing state by comparing the simulated clear-sky downward surface flux with the measured flux. We consider external, internal, and four combinations of core-shell (black carbon, BC over dust; water-soluble, WS over dust; WS over water-insoluble, WINS and BC over WINS) mixing. Our analysis reveals that choice of external mixing (usually considered in satellite retrievals and climate models) seems reasonable in Delhi only in the pre-monsoon (Mar-Jun) season. During the winter (Dec-Feb) and monsoon (Jul-Sep) seasons, 'WS coating over dust' externally mixed with BC and WINS appears to be the most probable mixing state; while 'WS coating over WINS' externally mixed with BC and dust seems to be the most probable mixing state in the post-monsoon (Oct-Nov) season.

This article established a method to estimate and analyze carbon emission from urban passenger transport including cars, rail transit, taxis and buses. The scope of research was defined based on car registration area, transport types and modes, the stages of rail transit energy consumption. The data availability and gathering were fully illustrated. A city level emission model for the aforementioned four modes of passenger transport was formulated, and parameters including emission factor of electricity and fuel efficiency were tailored according to local situations such as energy structure and field survey. The results reveal that the emission from Beijing's urban passenger transport in 2012 stood at 15 million tonnes of CO2, of which 75.5% was from cars, whereas car trip sharing constitutes only 42.5% of the total residential trips. Bus travel, yielding 28.6 g CO2, is the most efficient mode of transport under the current situations in terms of per passenger kilometer (PKM) emission, whereas car or taxi trips emit more than 5 times that of bus trips. Although a decrease trend appears, Beijing still has potential for further carbon reduction in passenger transport field in contrast to other cities in developed countries.

While the priority is given to sustainable mobility in cities, the development of the supply leads to increasing operating costs, but the receipts from customers is insufficient to cover the expenses. Taking the example of French cities, the article analyses the reasons of the explosion of deficits. As the design of the network is in France under the full responsibility of Transport Authorities, the growth of the supply is often driven by public policy objectives (accessibility to the city for disadvantaged people, reducing car use and CO2 emissions) rather than by the demand. Even if the patronage starts again increasing since 2000, the global performance of the network is not satisfying, as evidenced by the rather weak rate of utilisation (on average 4 trips per vehicule.km). Apart from the successful development of right-of-way systems (such as tramways), the extension of bus routes to lower density areas explains this mitigated result.

For this purpose, this study first calculated the area available for urban farming by targeting the metropolitan area of Seoul and then calculated the production per unit area by focusing on ""the crops suitable for urban agriculture"".

Decision-making units which are all data envelopment analysis (DEA)-effective cannot be ranked by using the original DEA model. While previous studies omit environmental factors when gauging resources or environmental efficiency. In this study, we combine a Ruggiero three-stage model with a super-efficiency DEA model (SE-DEA) to solve these two problems.

To collect the sample data, oneto-one interview was carried out in 1500 households in Seoul city to investigate energy consumption status and occupant characteristics. Result from the field survey showed that about 50.1% of respondents expect the increase of energy consumption in the future due to needs for convenience, while 28% responded that energy consumption would decrease. It was also surveyed that each household spends about 76 USD and 62 USD (393kWh/month) per month in gas and electric utility fees, respectively. Due to the preference for larger appliances, the capacity of the home appliances was similar regardless of family members. The survey result on energy attitudes and practices revealed that the older the respondents, the more seriously concerned they are about environmental problem, however, the lower the age, the higher the number of respondents check their energy consumption for energy save. Finally, recommend the increases in the unit prices of current energy costs and thereby fostering energy conservation are deemed as the priority to improve energy saving plan derived from the evaluation of the government's eight major policies from the perspective of their effectiveness and importance.

A case study of Ningbo city was used to make a detail analysis. Several factors were determined as the reasons for ever growing building energy consumption including climate change, household electricity load increase, the growth of real estate, fast-growing household electrical appliances, high energy consumption in existing buildings, changes in industrial structure and the lack of enhanced government supervision. Then the discussion of suitable countermeasures shows that only enhanced supervision strategies are currently applicable. Finally, it is concluded that enhanced government supervision strategies, including the establishment of a strict control system for new built buildings through information integration and encryption, establishing an energy efficiency supervision system of large-scale public building and a carrot-and-stick approach with added expert checklist for the building application of renewable energy, showed great advantages in promoting building energy efficiency in Ningbo. compared with other cities.

To rise to the challenges presently posed by climate change, strategies must be designed to reduce energy demand, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt the urban environment. As a substantial part of building envelopes, facades also play a predominant role in consolidated cities, for they impact thermal balance while also defining the outdoor space. Three optical parameters (colour, solar reflectance and emissivity) are studied to characterise the surface properties of enclosures and analyse their effect on three construction systems: the standard enclosure found on buildings in Madrid and two solutions to improve its thermal performance via energy rehabilitation. The findings show that since the surface features of elements govern temperature on outer facade surfaces, suitable design can lower the energy demand for thermal conditioning and improve both indoor and outdoor urban habitability.

1357,WOS:000290034200008,"During the past twenty-five years the land use controls that shape residential real estate development in the United States have changed in potentially significant ways. From the 1950s to the 1980s, land use laws promoted middle-class sprawl by reserving extensive tracts of land for the construction of moderately priced, single-family homes on lots of less than one acre. More recently, suburbs have adopted land use controls that promote upper class sprawl by reserving large areas for the construction of small numbers of expensive homes on spacious lots. This regulatory shift can be explained in several ways: a homevoter hypothesis that derives the new controls from the economic interests of suburban homeowners and a regional spillover hypothesis that attributes the adoption of new controls to desires by planning commissioners, consultants, and nongovernmental organizations to do as other communities are doing. We assess these explanations through a case study of changing land use controls in the suburban New Jersey Highlands west of New York City. Between 1975 and 2002 the region saw large increases in preserved open space, a doubling of the required minimum lot area for houses, increases in the real price of housing, declines in the number of newly constructed homes, and a shift in residential real estate development toward the urban core. Multivariate analyses of the changes in land use controls support the regional spillover hypothesis. The implications of this dynamic for conservation policies, environmental injustices, and greenhouse gas emissions are briefly explored.","Rudel, TK, O'Neill, K, Gottlieb, P, McDermott, M, Hatfield, C",14,New York City,USA,10.1080/00045608.2011.560062,SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),8175133,From Middle to Upper Class Sprawl?

Its 11 districts were divided into three climatic classes varying from high urban heat, low levels of green space and lack of proximity to water bodies to low urban heat, adequate green space and proximity to water bodies. Daily data on natural mortality, meteorological variables, and pollutants from May-October 1999-2008 were analysed using generalised additive models for the time-series data. Subgroup analyses were conducted, stratifying decedents according to the level of planning activity required in order to mitigate adverse heat effects in their residential areas, classifying districts as ""level 1"" for those requiring a high level of mitigation action; ""level 2"" for those requiring some action; and ""level 3"" for those that need only preserve existing conditions. Stratified analyses showed that mortality increases per 1 degrees C rise on average, either on the same day or in the previous 4 days (lags 0-4), were associated with 2.8%, 2.3% and - 1.3% for level 1, 2 and 3 districts, respectively. The slope describing the association between temperature and mortality was higher above 29.0 degrees C resulting in corresponding increases of 4.2%, 5.0% and 0.3% per per 1 degrees C rise in temperature, respectively. Other meteorological variables were not significantly associated with mortality. It is concluded that hot season mortality in Kaohsiung is only sensitive to heat effects in districts classified as having unfavourably climatic conditions and requiring mitigation efforts in city planning.

1359,WOS:000394400000050,"Dispersion of neutral and dense gas over a simplified urban area, comprising four cubes, has been investigated by the means of large-eddy simulations (LES). The results have been compared to wind tunnel experiments and both mean and fluctuating quantities of velocity and concentration are in very good agreement. High-quality inflow profiles are necessary to achieve physically realistic LES results. In this study, profiles matching the atmospheric boundary layer flow in the wind tunnel, are generated by means of a separate precursor simulation. Emission of dense gas dramatically alters the flow in the near source region and introduces an upstream dispersion. The resulting dispersion patterns of neutral and dense gas differ significantly, where the plume in the latter case is wider and shallower. The dense gas is highly affected by the cube array, which seems to act as a barrier, effectively deflecting the plume. This leads to higher concentrations outside of the array than inside. On the contrary, the neutral gas plume has a Gaussian-type shape, with highest concentrations along the centreline. It is found that the dense gas reduces the vertical and spanwise turbulent momentum transport and, as a consequence, the turbulence kinetic energy. The reduction coincides with the area where the gradient Richardson number exceeds its critical value, i.e. where the flow may be characterized as stably stratified. Interestingly, this region does not correspond to where the concentration of dense gas is the highest (close to the ground), as this is also where the largest velocity gradients are to be found. Instead there is a layer in the middle of the dense gas cloud where buoyancy is dynamically dominant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1362,WOS:000390732300039,"Initiatives to displace petroleum and climate change mitigation have driven a recent increase in space heating with biomass combustion. However, there is ample evidence that biomass combustion emits significant quantities of health damaging pollutants. We investigated the near-source micro-environmental air quality impact of a biomass-fueled combined heat and power system equipped with an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) in Syracuse, NY. Two rooftop sampling stations with PM2.5 and CO2 analyzers were established in such that one could capture the plume while the other one served as the background for comparison depending on the wind direction. Four sonic anemometers were deployed around the stack to quantify spatially and temporally resolved local wind patterns. Fuel-based emission factors were derived based on near-source measurement. The Comprehensive Turbulent Aerosol Dynamics and Gas Chemistry (CTAG) model was then applied to simulate the spatial variations of primary PM2.5 without ESP. Our analysis shows that the absence of ESP could lead to an almost 7 times increase in near-source primary PM2.5 concentrations with a maximum concentration above 100 mu g m(-)3 at the building rooftop. The above-ground ""hotspots"" would pose potential health risks to building occupants since particles could penetrate indoors via infiltration, natural ventilation, and fresh air intakes on the rooftop of multiple buildings. Our results demonstrated the importance of emission control for biomass combustion systems in urban area, and the need to take above-ground pollutant ""hotspots"" into account when permitting distributed generation. The effects of ambient wind speed and stack temperature, the suitability of airport meteorological data on micro-environmental air quality were explored, and the implications on mitigating near-source air pollution were discussed.

1363,WOS:000209553700001,"In 2011, China announced that it has reached an urbanisation rate of 50%. If we take rapid urbanisation as a given and that it is already well underway, it is still widely unclear what research needs to be conducted and policy changes made to support municipalities of fast transforming cities and to avoid repeating the development mistakes that have occurred in industrialised nations, i.e. driving urban growth with high consumption patterns without fully considering the environmental and social needs and occupants' behaviour and aspirations. The scale and pace of change requires a solid systems approach of urban development. The purpose of this paper is to explore the rapid urbanisation of Chinese cities with a focus on the plans for a new, on-going urban sub-centre in the north-west of Shanghai: Zhenru urban sub-centre. Information-rich urbanisation is a defining feature of the 21st century, reshaping cities and communities in China and in developing countries around the world. The paper compares two cases of urban development patterns for new sub-centres for polycentric city structures: it relates to new urban sub-centres in Berlin (Germany) and Shanghai (China), and the relationship of these sub-centres to 'Network City' theory. Network theory is useful in this context as the 'network' metaphor and concepts of decentralisation seem to have replaced the 'machine' metaphor which was based on efficiency based on the availability of cheap fossil fuels. The question to be addressed is how Chinese cities can be better steered towards more sustainable models of development. As cities aim to move towards more resilient urban ecosystems and polycentric systems, the case of Potsdamer Platz Berlin, compared to Zhenru sub-centre in Shanghai, is discussed. Both are transport-oriented developments promoting mixed-use density and less car-dependency. According to documentation of the Shanghai municipality, Zhenru urban centre, which is currently in its planning phase, is supposed to become a 'new sustainable sub-centre for a growing metropolis'. Based on the Potsdamer Platz experience, where an isolated 'City within the City' was developed, a series of careful recommendations are formulated for the design and development of such centres, knowing that it is rather difficult to translate from one case to the other. The conclusion includes five lessons (recommendations) from Potsdamer Platz for the urban design of new sub-centres to ensure a delivery of economical, social and environmental sustainable outcomes. A core finding is that drawing lessons from the German case study for Chinese urbanisation seemed a useful tactic and gave a sense that there are underlying urban design strategies. However, the conversion of such strategies to another cultural and social context requires further research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The study is based on the real, Ruukki Metals Ltd.'s existing steel mill, located in the city of Raahe, Finland. Implications of application of OBF to energy and mass balances at the site are studied. Based on the technical evaluation, costs and feasibility for carbon capture are estimated. The energy and mass balance basis is presented in this first part of the series of two papers. Costs, feasibility and sensitivity analysis are assessed in the second part of the series (Tsupari et al. 2014. Int. J. Greenhouse Gas Control). The impact of applying OBF at an integrated steel mill is evaluated based on a consequential assessment following the methodology of Arasto et al. (2013). Int. J.

The technical processes, CO2 capture and the steelmaking processes affected were modelled using Aspen Plus process modelling software and the results were used to estimate the CO2 emission reduction potential with OBF technology at an integrated steel mill. The results show that the CO2 emission from an iron and steel mill can be significantly reduced by application of an oxygen blast furnace and CCS. By applying only the blast furnace process, the emissions can already be reduced by 1.2 Mt/a without storing the separated CO2. If captured CO2 is also purified and stored permanently, the emission can be further reduced by an additional 1.4 Mt/a. This is a significant reduction considering that the production of the mill stays the same as in the reference case. In addition to carbon footprint of the production, application of oxygen blast furnace also has significant impact on coke consumption and energy balance on the site. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The research investigates a case study located in a university campus in Toronto, Canada. After completing a detailed energy audit of the building, an assessment of the benefits resulting from the installation of an extensive green roof was performed. A virtual model validated using multiyear data of a local network of different weather stations was used to simulate the effects of the green roof retrofit over the outdoor microclimate. Then, a building energy model was used to compare the energy saving of several green roof designs. Results indicate that increasing the leaf area index (LAI) would lead to an increased cooling effect of the air temperature up to 0.4 degrees C during the day at pedestrian level, while a more significant temperature reduction would be obtained only at the rooftop level. This confirms the potential of green roofs as urban heat island mitigation strategy. The adoption of a green roof retrofit resulted in a building energy demand reduction by 3%, and in significantly improved indoor comfort levels in the floor below the green roof. Finally, the parametric analysis of different green roof options showed that for building energy savings, increasing the soil depth is more important than increasing the LAI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While many cities have adopted ambitious long-term emission reduction goals, few have articulated how to reach them. This paper presents one of the first long-term scenarios of deep greenhouse gas abatement for a major U.S. city. Using a detailed, bottom-up scenario analysis, we investigate how Seattle might achieve its recently stated goal of carbon neutrality by the year 2050. The analysis demonstrates that a series of ambitious strategies could achieve per capita GHG reductions of 34% in 2020, and 91% in 2050 in Seattle's ""core"" emissions from the buildings, transportation, and waste sectors. We examine the pros and cons of options to get to, or beyond, net zero emissions in these sectors. We also discuss methodological innovations for community-scale emissions accounting frameworks, including a ""core"" emissions focus that excludes industrial activity and a consumption perspective that expands the emissions footprint and scope of policy solutions.

Under the planned policies, a 31% reduction in per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is estimated, with most of the savings due to reduced electrical emissions intensity under Ontario's Integrated Systems Plan, as well as a reduction in internal combustion automobile use. With the more aggressive scenario, buildings, energy and transport-related GHG emissions could be reduced to 6 Mt CO(2)e, or 1.9 tonnes per capita, a reduction in per capita emissions of 71% compared to the base case. Significant strategies under the aggressive scenario include retrofitting all existing buildings, utilizing renewable heating and cooling systems, and the proliferation of electric automobiles.","Sugar, L, Kennedy, C",5,Ontario; Toronto,USA; CAN,10.1139/cjce-2011-0523,SRID=4326;POINT (-117.65089 34.06334); SRID=4326;POINT (-79.41630000000001 43.70011),171214; 2600000,"A low carbon infrastructure plan for Toronto, Canada",2013
1372,WOS:000295327900037,"Hindering urban sprawl is one of the main goals for contemporary urban planning. Urban density is considered crucial in climate change mitigation since it reduces automobile dependence and decreases unit sizes, for example. This letter analyzes the effect of density in a city context. In the study the Finnish capital Helsinki is divided into two areas of different urban densities: the high density downtown area and the more scarcely populated suburbs. The study is a continuation of a recently published study on the implications of urban structure on carbon emissions, and analyzes further the main finding of the first study-that higher urban density might have negligible or even reverse effect on the per capita carbon emissions. Similarly to the previous study, a consumption based tiered hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is employed in order to produce a comprehensive assessment, free of territorial boundaries and system cutoffs typical of traditional LCAs. Based on the findings of the previous study, it is hypothesized that when assessing city level carbon dioxide emissions from a wider, consumer oriented LCA perspective, increased urban density may not necessarily reduce carbon emissions. Surprisingly, the study finds that carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions are substantially higher in the dense downtown area than in the surrounding suburbs, which is suggested to imply that the increased consumption due to the higher standard of living increases emissions more than the higher density is able to reduce them. The results demonstrate that, while increasing urban density can be justified from a number of ecological, social and economic viewpoints, density is not necessarily a key parameter in the particular case of climate change. In cities like Helsinki, where wealth is concentrated in the downtown area, climate policies should give higher priority to the energy consumption of buildings, to alternative energy production and distribution modes, as well as to low carbon consumption within the city.","Heinonen, J, Kyro, R, Junnila, S",21,Helsinki,FIN,10.1088/1748-9326/6/3/034034,SRID=4326;POINT (24.93545 60.16952),558457,Dense downtown living more carbon intense due to higher consumption: a case study of Helsinki,2011
1373,WOS:000414882300003,"Spatial planning plays an increasingly significant role in climate change mitigation by providing energy efficient settlements and promoting the utilization of renewable energy resources. However, the effect of urban spatial planning on spatial pattern of carbon dioxide emissions in cities is rarely discussed. The relationships between the changes in urban zoning plans and carbon dioxide emissions of major economic sectors has yet to be investigated on a scale smaller than an entire city. Using the Taipei metropolitan area as a case study, this study hypothesizes that: (1) carbon dioxide emissions have a spatial dimension within the city due mainly to the heterogeneous nature of land use activities and urbanization, and (2) changes in spatial planning can influence the urban form, and consequentially affect carbon dioxide emissions through changes in traffic demand and energy consumption. A downscaling analysis approach was used to estimate carbon dioxide emissions of different sectors for each administrative district in the Taipei metropolitan area. The analytical results reveal that the total carbon dioxide emissions of the four sectors in the Taipei metropolitan area increased with the increases in the growth of urban planned zones during the period 1981-2011. The carbon dioxide emission increases were correlated with the distribution of land uses in each administrative district. A negative correlation was found between the population density and the per-capita carbon dioxide emissions in the transportation sector. The compact development and planning of urban transit systems are believed to be the source of decreasing per capita carbon dioxide emissions. While many studies have emphasized that spatial planning is important addressing climate change, this work demonstrates understanding the historic links between spatial planning and carbon dioxide is equally valuable.",,0,Taipei,TWN,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.08.001,SRID=4326;POINT (121.53185 25.04776),7871900,"Can spatial planning really mitigate carbon dioxide emissions in urban areas?

1374,WOS:000372942100017,"Recently, electric vehicles are gaining importance which helps to reduce dependency on oil, increases energy efficiency of transportation, reduces carbon emissions and noise, and avoids tail pipe emissions. Because of short daily driving distances, high mileage, and intermediate waiting time, fossil-fuelled taxi vehicles are ideal candidates for being replaced by battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Moreover, taxi BEVs would increase visibility of electric mobility and therefore encourage others to purchase an electric vehicle. Prior to replacing conventional taxis with BEVs, a suitable charging infrastructure has to be established. This infrastructure consists of a sufficiently dense network of charging stations taking into account the lower driving ranges of BEVs. In this case study we propose a decision support system for placing charging stations in order to satisfy the charging demand of electric taxi vehicles. Operational taxi data from about 800 vehicles is used to identify and estimate the charging demand for electric taxis based on frequent origins and destinations of trips. Next, a variant of the maximal covering location problem is formulated and solved to satisfy as much charging demand as possible with a limited number of charging stations. Already existing fast charging locations are considered in the optimization problem. In this work, we focus on finding regions in which charging stations should be placed rather than exact locations. The exact location within an area is identified in a post-optimization phase (e.g., by authorities), where environmental conditions are considered, e.g., the capacity of the power network, availability of space, and legal issues. Our approach is implemented in the city of Vienna, Austria, in the course of an applied research project that has been conducted in 2014. Local authorities, power network operators, representatives of taxi driver guilds as well as a radio taxi provider participated in the project and identified exact locations for charging stations based on our decision support system.

To achieve this objective, we first gather the required data from the national meteorological organization, and then use Homer software to perform technical and economic analyses on the two considered sites. Solar and wind analyses on Qom and Yazd show that both cities have great potential in solar energy generation, but wind speed data indicate that only Qom has the wind characteristics appropriate for wind power generation.

Focused on local needs and priorities, these planning processes are raising tensions between more compact and dense urban form to reduce energy use and associated emissions and the provision of urban green infrastructure for ecosystem services and climate adaptation. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of green infrastructure at the neighbourhood scale in Sydney, Australia and examined how a mix of landscape types (pavement, bare soil/dry grass, green grass, and tree cover) affect temperature variation in three important locations for urban residents-around the home, in the roads and footpaths where people walk, and in parkland areas. Considering that residential and parkland areas contribute to the majority of green space in Sydney, it is important to understand how changes in landscape mix within these three neighbourhood areas will affect local temperature for urban residents. For residential houses, it was found that the percentage of tree canopy cover around the house had a significant negative relationship (p = 0.002) with surface temperatures of rooftops where greater tree cover led to lower rooftop temperatures. In streetscapes, both the percentage of tree cover (p < 0.0001) and the percentage of green grass (p < 0.0001) within the road segment had a significant negative relationship with the surface temperature of the road pavement. In the parks, the percentage of pavement (p < 0.0001) and the percentage of bare soil/dry grass (p < 0.0001) showed a significantly positive trend with land surface temperatures where greater land cover in the form of pavement and bare soil/dry grass led to higher temperatures.

To identify the critical factors influencing GHG emissions from MSWI in China, a GHG accounting model was established and applied to six Chinese cities located in different regions. The results showed that MSWI in most of the cities was the source of GHGs, with emissions of 25-207 kg CO2-eq t(-1) rw. Within all process stages, the emission of fossil CO2 from the combustion of MSW was the main contributor (111-254 kg CO2- eq t(-1) rw), while the substitution of electricity reduced the GHG emissions by 150-247 kg CO2-eq t(-1) rw. By affecting the fossil carbon content and the lower heating value of the waste, the contents of plastic and food waste in the MSW were the critical factors influencing GHG emissions of MSWI. Decreasing food waste content in MSW by half will significantly reduce the GHG emissions from MSWI, and such a reduction will convert MSWI in Urumqi and Tianjin from GHG sources to GHG sinks. Comparison of the GHG emissions in the six Chinese cities with those in European countries revealed that higher energy recovery efficiency in Europe induced much greater reductions in GHG emissions.

Stormwater in urban areas has traditionally been collected and conveyed to sewage treatment plants, a practice that has continued with the need to manage increased superficial flow. This paper presents the Low Impact Development (LID) measures to improve water management in the new urban development of Valdebebas in Madrid, and the associated benefits. Stormwater was considered a sub cycle; by shortening the water cycle the local use of rainwater was achieved while reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions for off-site treatment. The article analyses the urban water cycle from a preventive approach. It considers how urban design features such as topography and pavement selection were used to convey surface water from impermeable areas to permeable ones (vegetated or permeable pavements) and the infiltration of water into engineered soil, reducing the need for off-site conveyance infrastructure, and the amount of water discharged into municipal treatment installations. Moreover, the captured water increases soil water content available for plants and trees which play an important role in absorbing CO2. Water exceeding soil capacity is collected in the subsurface Sustainable Drainage system (SuDS), including infiltration boxes where water is temporarily stored before moving through the soil toward ground water reserves. This paper describes the approaches and criteria used to design a large scale SuDS infrastructure in the district of Valdebebas, in northeastern Madrid (Spain), and analyses its performance, followed by a comparison with the predictions under three climate change scenarios, which consider not only the variation in peak flows and runoff, but also the reduction in GHG emissions.

Biotic treatments were designed to improve tree growth, with the expectation that higher tree species composition (six vs. two) and greater stand complexity (with shrubs vs. without) would facilitate tree performance. Similarly, the abiotic treatment (compost amendment vs. without) was expected to increase tree performance by improving soil conditions. Growth and survival was measured for approximately 1,300 native saplings across three growing seasons. The biotic and abiotic treatments significantly improved tree performance, where shrub presence increased tree height for five of the six tree species, and compost increased basal area and stem volume of all species. Species-specific responses, however, highlighted the difficulty of achieving rapid growth with limited mortality. Pioneer species had the highest growth in stem volume over 3 years (up to 3,500%), but also the highest mortality (up to 40%). Mid-successional species had lower mortality (<16%), but also the slowest growth in volume (approximately 500% in volume). Our results suggest that there will be trade-offs between optimizing tree growth versus survival when implementing urban tree planting initiatives.","Oldfield, EE, Felson, AJ, Auyeung, DSN, Crowther, TW, Sonti, NF, Harada, Y, Maynard, DS, Sokol, NW, Ashton, MS, Warren, RJ, Hallett, RA, Bradford, MA",5,New York City,USA,10.1111/rec.12230,SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),8175133,Growing the urban forest: tree performance in response to biotic and abiotic land management,2015
1391,WOS:000380624400006,"An analysis of material flows that also considers economic and social indicators has been performed at the national (Sweden) and urban scale (Stockholm and Gothenburg) to study the dynamics of resource use during the last two decades. A summary of policies related to resource consumption implemented at the EU, national and local scale is presented and their probable effects discussed based on empirical evidence. The resource consumption trends indicate that the implemented policies have failed to bring significant reductions in resource and energy throughput. Resource consumption has increased both in Sweden as a whole and in the studied cities. Moreover, the consumption of construction materials and electronics has grown exponentially, even when normalized by population. The few success stories are the absolute reduction in fossil fuel consumption achieved in Stockholm, building energy reduction by halve and complete abolishment of oil as the heating fuel in Sweden. The lifestyle characteristics that have an impact on resource consumption include high income, car ownership, large residential floor space, social movements and trends related to dietary choices. The consumption of electronics, textiles and cosmetic products was shown to have increased considerably. The same quantities of food are consumed, but the diet has changed. Waste generation by far outpaces improvements in recycling. In recycling, waste-to-energy is growing faster than material recycling, which impedes the development of a circular economy. The main limitation of the policies implemented to-date is that they only address efficiency of use, but do nothing to reduce the demand for resources. In addition, efforts have so far been restricted to energy consumption. The reality is that we must urgently reduce the consumption of all resources, not just fossil fuels. We call for greater concern and more action towards reducing nonfuel resource consumption. (C) 2015 The Authors.

1392,WOS:000293065800004,"Cool roofs-roofs that stay cool in the sun by minimizing solar absorption and maximizing thermal emission-lessen the flow of heat from the roof into the building, reducing the need for space cooling energy in conditioned buildings. Cool roofs may also increase the need for heating energy in cold climates. For a commercial building, the decrease in annual cooling load is typically much greater than the increase in annual heating load. This study combines building energy simulations, local energy prices, local electricity emission factors, and local estimates of building density to characterize local, state average, and national average cooling energy savings, heating energy penalties, energy cost savings, and emission reductions per unit conditioned roof area. The annual heating and cooling energy uses of four commercial building prototypes-new office (1980+), old office (pre-1980), new retail (1980+), and old retail (pre-1980)-were simulated in 236 US cities. Substituting a weathered cool white roof (solar reflectance 0.55) for a weathered conventional gray roof (solar reflectance 0.20) yielded annually a cooling energy saving per unit conditioned roof area ranging from 3.30 kWh/m(2) in Alaska to 7.69 kWh/m(2) in Arizona (5.02 kWh/m(2) nationwide); a heating energy penalty ranging from 0.003 therm/m(2) in Hawaii to 0.14 therm/m(2) in Wyoming (0.065 therm/m(2) nationwide); and an energy cost saving ranging from $0.126/m(2) in West Virginia to $1.14/m(2) in Arizona ($0.356/m(2) nationwide). It also offered annually a CO(2) reduction ranging from 1.07 kg/m(2) in Alaska to 4.97 kg/m(2) in Hawaii (3.02 kg/m(2) nationwide); an NO(x) reduction ranging from 1.70 g/m(2) in New York to 11.7 g/m(2) in Hawaii (4.81 g/m(2) nationwide); an SO(2) reduction ranging from 1.79 g/m(2) in California to 26.1 g/m(2) in Alabama (12.4 g/m(2) nationwide); and an Hg reduction ranging from 1.08 mu g/m(2) in Alaska to 105 mu g/m(2) in Alabama (61.2 mu g/m(2) nationwide). Retrofitting 80% of the 2.58 billion square meters of commercial building conditioned roof area in the USA would yield an annual cooling energy saving of 10.4 TWh; an annual heating energy penalty of 133 million therms; and an annual energy cost saving of $735 million. It would also offer an annual CO(2) reduction of 6.23 Mt, offsetting the annual CO(2) emissions of 1.20 million typical cars or 25.4 typical peak power plants; an annual NO(x) reduction of 9.93 kt, offsetting the annual NO(x) emissions of 0.57 million cars or 65.7 peak power plants; an annual SO(2) reduction of 25.6 kt, offsetting the annual SO(2) emissions of 815 peak power plants; and an annual Hg reduction of 126 kg.","Levinson, R, Akbari, H",62,Wyoming; New York City,USA; USA,10.1007/s12053-008-9038-2,SRID=4326;POINT (-92.99715999999999 45.33636); SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427),7813; 8175133,"Potential benefits of cool roofs on commercial buildings: conserving energy, saving money, and reducing emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants",2010
1393,WOS:000333778400031,"A balance between industrial pollution prevention and economic growth becomes a world-wide issue to develop a sustainable society in many industrial nations. To discuss the issue, this study proposes a new use of DEA environmental assessment to determine how to effectively allocate capital for developing regional industries. The amount of capital is used to invest for technology innovation for both local economic growth and environmental protection. In this study, the proposed approach separates outputs into desirable and undesirable categories. Inputs are also separated into two categories, one of which indicates an amount of investment on capital assets. The other category is used for production activities. The proposed approach unifies them by two disposability concepts. This study has evaluated the performance of manufacturing industries in 47 prefectures (local government units in Japan) by Unified Efficiency under Natural disposability (UEN), Unified Efficiency under Managerial disposability (UEM) and Unified Efficiency under Natural and Managerial disposability (UENM). The UENM is further separated into its two cases: with and without a possible occurrence on desirable congestion, or technology innovation, on undesirable outputs. This study has empirically confirmed that Japanese manufacturing industries need to make their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution substances by investing in technology innovation. Furthermore, most of economic activities are currently located at metropolitan regions (e.g., Tokyo) in Japan. To develop a sustainable society, Japan needs to allocate capital into regions with a high level of investment effectiveness by shifting the manufacturing industries from the metropolitan regions to much promising local areas identified in this study. Such a shift, along with technology innovation, makes it possible to reduce air pollutions in the entire Japan by balancing economic growth and pollution prevention. This empirical study confirms that the proposed approach is useful in both guiding regional planning and developing a sustainable society. It is easily envisioned that the proposed approach is useful for not only Japan but also the other industrial and developing nations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These events can disproportionately impact the health of low-income, minority, and urban populations. To better understand heat-related intervention strategies used by four U.S. cities, we conducted 73 semi-structured interviews with government and non-governmental organization leaders representing public health, general social services, emergency management, meteorology, and the environmental planning sectors in Detroit, MI; New York City, NY; Philadelphia, PA and Phoenix, AZ-cities selected for their diverse demographics, climates, and climate adaptation strategies. We identified activities these leaders used to reduce the harmful effects of heat for residents in their city, as well as the obstacles they faced and the approaches they used to evaluate these efforts. Local leaders provided a description of how local context (e. g., climate, governance and city structure) impacted heat preparedness. Despite the differences among study cities, political will and resource access were critical to driving heat-health related programming. Upon completion of our interviews, we convened leaders in each city to discuss these findings and their ongoing efforts through day-long workshops.

1395,WOS:000350473300007,"ObjectivesThis multi-center study was conducted to objectively evaluate energy expenditure and physical activity (PA) patterns on school days and weekends in urban 11-year-olds. MethodsThe sample consisted of 241 children from three cities: Zagreb, Ljubljana (both in Central Europe) and Ann Arbor (United States). Energy expenditure and PA were assessed during two school days and two weekend days using a multiple-sensor body monitor. ResultsDifferences between the cities were observed for all PA variables. The highest level of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was noted in Ljubljana boys [284 (98) min/day] and the lowest in Zagreb girls [179 (95) min/day]. In Zagreb and Ljubljana, boys were more physically active than girls, while in Ann Arbor the opposite was observed. In contrast, no gender difference in sedentary behavior was observed in any of the cities. A decline in PA from school days to weekends was noted in all city groups in both genders. However, the magnitude of the reduction in daily energy expenditure differed between the cities, with the largest differences being observed in Ljubljana and the smallest in Ann Arbor. In all three city groups, the great majority of boys and girls achieved current recommendations of 60 min of MVPA either during school days or weekends. ConclusionsWeekends seem to be an appropriate target when promoting PA in 11-year-olds in all the cities included in the study.

1396,WOS:000375170600024,"Rising population, income and urbanization are increasing urban passenger transport demand in India. Energy and emissions intensities associated with conventional transport are no longer sustainable vis-a-vis energy security, air quality and climate change. Cities are seeking transport roadmaps that jointly mitigate these risks. Roadmaps vary across cities, but approach to delineate actions is common: (i) 'representative vision' that articulates long-term goals, (ii) methods for comparative scenarios assessment, and (iii) quantification of co-benefits to prioritize actions. This paper illustrates application of quantitative modeling to assess development and environmental co-benefits for Ahmedabad city. The paper constructs two transport scenarios spanning till 2035. The bifurcating themes are: (i) Business-as-Usual (BAU) and Low Carbon Scenario (LCS). The quantitative assessment using Extended Snapshot (ExSS) Model shows that transport activity shall result in four-fold increase in energy demand under BAU from 2010 to 2035. Three key contributors to CO2 mitigation under LCS in merit order are: (i) fuel switch, including decarbonized electricity, (ii) modal shift, and (iii) substitution of travel demand. Scenarios analysis shows that LCS improves energy security by reducing oil demand and also delivers air quality co-benefits - reducing 74% NOx and 83% PM2.5 from the passenger transport sector compared to BAU in 2035. Finally, the paper argues that cities in developing countries can leverage carbon finance to develop sustainable and low carbon mobility plans that prevent adverse infrastructure and behavioral lock-ins and prompt low carbon development.

1397,WOS:000294834900006,"The use of hygroscopic materials for moisture buffering is a passive way to moderate the variation of indoor humidity. Through absorption and desorption, surface materials in the indoor environment, such as curtains, carpets and wall paper, are able to dampen the moisture variations. The moisture buffering capacity of these materials may be used to improve the relative humidity of the indoor environment at reduced energy costs. The objectives of this paper are threefold. The first objective is to derive a theoretical model for the transient moisture transfer between a curtain system and the indoor air for the case where the curtain is placed in front of a wall. The second objective is to conduct experiments inside environmental chambers to validate the theoretical model and to test the ability of curtains to moderate indoor humidity. It is shown that the experimental results for the curtain moisture uptake and the relative humidity inside the chamber compared well with the model simulation results. The third and final objective is to test and evaluate the model under ""real environment conditions"" for a case study of a hygroscopic cotton curtain, placed in a ""typical"" office space in the city of Beirut with an area of 25 m(2) that uses direct expansion (DX) air conditioning system. It is found that hygroscopic curtains maintain humidity of less than 65% during part load operation compared to the upper limit of 70% relative humidity when no curtain is used. On the other hand, it is found that the energy use, as determined by the daily electrical power consumption of the DX system, is almost the same for the two cases, (with and without a curtain), where approximately 20 kWh of energy input is required 13 kWh of sensible energy and 7 kWh of latent energy.

1398,WOS:000338599800012,"Urban areas are considered net consumers of materials and energy, attracting these from the surrounding hinterland and other parts of the planet. The way these flows are transformed and returned to the environment by the city is important for addressing questions of sustainability and the effect of human behavior on the metabolism of the city. The present work explores these questions with the use of systems analysis, specifically in the form of a Multi-sectoral Systems Analysis (MSA), a tool for research and for supporting decision-making for policy and investment. The application of MSA is illustrated in the context of Greater London, with these three objectives: (a) estimating resource fluxes (nutrients, water and energy) entering, leaving and circulating within the city-watershed system; (b) revealing the synergies and antagonisms resulting from various combinations of water-sector innovations; and (c) estimating the economic benefits associated with implementing these technologies, from the point of view of production of fertilizer and energy, and the reduction of greenhouse gases. Results show that the selection of the best technological innovation depends on which resource is the focus for improvement. Urine separation can potentially recover 47% of the nitrogen in the food consumed in London, with revenue of $33 M per annum from fertilizer production. Collecting food waste in sewers together with growing algae in wastewater treatment plants could beneficially increase the amount of carbon release from renewable energy by 66%, with potential annual revenues of $58 M from fuel production.

The long-term impacts of moving people closer to transit require the coupling of behavioral forecasting with environmental assessment. Using new light rail and bus rapid transit in Los Angeles, California as a case study, a life-cycle environmental and economic assessment is developed to assess the potential range of impacts resulting from mixed-use infill development. An integrated transportation and land use life-cycle assessment framework is developed to estimate energy consumption, air emissions, and economic (public, developer, and user) costs. Residential and commercial buildings, automobile travel, and transit operation changes are included and a 60-year forecast is developed that compares transit-oriented growth against growth in areas without close access to high-capacity transit service. The results show that commercial developments create the greatest potential for impact reductions followed by residential commute shifts to transit, both of which may be effected by access to high-capacity transit, reduced parking requirements, and developer incentives. Greenhouse gas emission reductions up to 470 Gg CO2-equivalents per year can be achieved with potential costs savings for TOD users. The potential for respiratory impacts (PM-m-equivalents) and smog formation can be reduced by 28-35%.

1400,WOS:000360586600001,"Pyrolysis is the thermo-chemical conversion of carbonaceous feedstock in the absence of oxygen to produce bio-fuel (bio-oil, bio-char and syn-gas). Bio-fuel production from municipal green waste (MGW) through the pyrolysis process has attracted considerable attention recently in the renewable energy sector because it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to energy security. This study analyses properties of MGW feedstock available in Rockhampton city of Central Queensland, Australia, and presents an experimental investigation of producing bio-fuel from that MGW through the pyrolysis process using a short sealed rotary furnace. It was found from the experiment that about 19.97% bio-oil, 40.83% bio-char and 29.77% syn-gas can be produced from the MGW. Then, a four-stage steady state simulation model is developed for pyrolysis process performance simulation using Aspen Plus software. In the first stage, the moisture content of the MGW feed is reduced. In the second stage, the MGW is decomposed according to its elemental constituents. In the third stage, condensate material is separated and, finally, the pyrolysis reactions are modelled using the Gibbs free energy minimisation approach. The MGW's ultimate and proximate analysis data were used in the Aspen Plus simulation as input parameters. The model is validated with experimentally measured data. A good agreement between simulation and experimental results was found. More specifically, the variation of modelling and experimental elemental compositions of the MGW was found to be 7.3% for carbon, 15.82% for hydrogen, 7.04% for nitrogen and 5.56% for sulphur.

Concerning downsizing concept, to maintain a reasonable power level in small engines, the application of turbocharging is mandatory both for spark ignited (SI) and compression ignited (CI) engines. Following this aspect, the possibility to couple an electric drive to the turbocharger (electric turbo compound) to recover the residual energy of the exhaust gases is becoming more and more attractive, as demonstrated by several studies around the world and by the current application in the F1 Championship. The present paper shows the first numerical results of a research program in collaboration between the Universities of Pisa and Genoa. This first study is focused on the evaluation of the benefits resulting from the application of an ETC (Electric Turbo Compound) to a small twin-cylinder SI engine (900 cm(3)). Starting from the experimental maps of two turbines and one compressor, the complete model of a turbocharged engine was created using the AVL BOOST one-dimension code. The numerical activity then moves to the whole vehicle/powertrain modelling, considering three driving cycles and two different vehicle configurations, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ETC solution. Results show that the adoption of ETC is not advantageous if used for a conventional turbocharger turbine, if the target is to optimize the overall efficiency in one specific operating point of the ICE, like in the case of range-extended electric vehicles. Besides, ETC can slightly improve the average overall efficiency when the ICE must provide variable power output, as in the case of conventional or hybrid vehicles. However, the major benefits coming from ETC are the boost range extension in the lowest engine rotational speed region and a possible reduction of turbo lag, which are key points in parallel-hybrid and especially in conventional vehicles. Concerning the whole vehide/powertrain simulation, first results show that the ETC does not improve fuel economy of the smaller vehicle, especially when employed in urban cycles. The ETC is much more advantageous in the case of the larger vehicle, particularly when extra-urban roads or motorways are considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The mix of social, economic, political, and climatic factors that created a series of national and international controversies over the diversion since 1896 was defined and is the subject of this review. Information was gathered using a literature survey and from experts in hydrology, law, economics, and political science. The historical analysis revealed that the events causing controversies fell within five distinct periods. The 1845-1890 period involved attempts to solve the sewage disposal problems of a rapidly growing Chicago. Polluted waters were being emitted into Lake Michigan causing a series of major typhoid epidemics, and in 1886 the city decided to build a large 45-km-long canal to divert lake water and flush the city's diluted sewage into the Illinois River system. During the 1891-1930 period increasing amounts of water diverted caused four major controversies: Chicago was pitted against Missouri, the federal government, the other states around the Great Lakes, and Canada. The 1931-1956 period had a federally-forced reduction of the diversion after prolonged debates in the U.S. Supreme Court. Illinois frequently attempted to get the diversion increased with controversies over each attempt, and the build-up of navigation in the canal and Illinois River created a new need for diverted water The 1957-1978 period had a major diversion controversy which went to the Supreme Court as a result of four factors: a temporary increase in the diversion to alleviate drought problems in the Mississippi River basin, the growth of Chicago's suburbs and their attendant demands for lake water, the demands for water by the development of more hydropower plants along the lakes' exit, and the opening of the Sr. Lawrence Seaway. This controversy was resolved in 1967, and Illinois found the Court's new guidelines unwieldy, ushering in the 1979-1994 period. The Supreme Court again handled the controversy over Illinois' request to change the accounting method for the water diverted. As this period ended in 1994, yet another controversy was brewing over federal claims that Illinois was exceeding the allotted diversion. The 100-year history of controversies over the Chicago diversion contains four lessons for the future. First, future social, economic and political forces affecting the use and control of the Great Lakes waters, both within and outside the basin, will change as both nations' political and economic worlds shift. Second, Chicago's ever continuing growth will lead to calls for more water from the lakes. Third a major change in climate would likely reduce water levels in the lakes, produce new demands for Great Lakes water and create major diversion controversies. Finally, controversies over the Chicago diversion, and other proposed diversions from the Great Lakes, seem a realistic forecast for the future, with or without a change in climate.","Changnon, SA, Changnon, JM",14,Chicago; Bozeman,USA; USA,10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70940-1,SRID=4326;POINT (-87.65004999999999 41.85003); SRID=4326;POINT (-111.03856 45.67965),2720546; 43405,History of the Chicago diversion and future implications,1996
1406,WOS:000382794200075,"This paper investigates how greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation benefits and cost-effectiveness of weatherization treatments vary geographically due to differences in climate, energy production mix, and housing stock. Using a treatment cost database and methods that estimate the residential energy savings from weatherization, we estimated energy cost savings, GHG savings, and measurements of cost-effectiveness. Combinations of three weatherization treatments were modeled: replacing a standard thermostat with a programmable thermostat, installing attic insulation, and envelop air sealing. These treatments were modeled for the low-income housing stock of six contrasting American urban areas: Orlando, Florida; Los Angeles-Long Beach, California; Seattle, Washington; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Detroit, Michigan; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Results show that (1) regional variations have high impact on the cost-effectiveness of weatherization treatments, (2) housing stocks with substantial electric space conditioning tend to offer greater energy cost and GHG savings, (3) the effect of a GHG price is small compared to energy cost savings when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of weatherization treatments, and (4) installing programmable thermostats is the most cost-effective treatment. This study highlights the importance of thoughtful consideration of weatherization program goals when selecting cities or regions to prioritize because different goals suggest different weatherization strategies.

1407,WOS:000284418100017,"Hundreds of local governments in the United States have adopted greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals during the past several years, requiring critical examinations of the role of the state in climate governance and the effects of these programs on urban citizenship. Using a study of Seattle, Washington, a city at the forefront of implementing climate regulations through formal government institutions, this article examines how and why climate is incorporated into local environmental policy. By deliberately connecting the causes and consequences of global climate change to the local community, Seattle has been able to use climate as a conceptual resource for urban environmental policy via the climatization of the urban environment. Furthermore, a key mechanism for making climate governable in Seattle is the carbonization of urban governance, where a relationship between the production of GHG emissions and specific urban activities is established through the use of GHG inventories and emissions monitoring. These practices facilitate the act of territorialization, where material natures and state institutions are coconstituted through the production of carbon territories. A key effect of these practices is that Seattle has begun to enroll its residents as a new type of carbon-relevant citizen in the regulation of global climate, while also reaffirming its ability to regulate infrastructural design, commercial activities, and community development. These findings are discussed with respect to their implications for how we understand state practice in climate governance, as well as the relationship between ""the state"" and ""nature"" in environmental politics.","Rice, JL",53,"Washington, D.C.; Seattle",USA; USA,10.1080/00045608.2010.502434,SRID=4326;POINT (-77.03637000000001 38.89511); SRID=4326;POINT (-122.33207 47.60621),601723; 684451,"Climate, Carbon, and Territory: Greenhouse Gas Mitigation in Seattle, Washington",2010

Drastic urban expansion under the current rapid urbanisation process tends to worsen these impacts. This paper examines the impacts of the patterns of urban development on motorised travel in the case of Beijing. By using household survey data, the analysis finds that the patterns of urban development on the urban fringe have a significant impact on workers' car use for their journeys to work when their socio-economic characteristics, household preferences for housing location and level of public transport accessibility are taken into account. Sprawling industrial and real estate development, characterised by a low degree of self-contained development and low-density land use, tends to increase the need to drive. The findings suggest that growth management to control sprawling development would play an important role in containing the motorised travel demand in China where transport policies are usually focused on huge and expensive transport projects. Urban growth management can have significant implications for achieving the objectives of creating a low-carbon city in China in the current process of rapid urbanisation.","Zhao, PJ, Lu, B",9,Beijing,CHN,10.1080/09640568.2010.547684,SRID=4326;POINT (116.39723 39.9075),11716620,Managing urban growth to reduce motorised travel in Beijing: one method of creating a low-carbon city,2011
1409,WOS:000334151600012,"In 2008 the City of Orlando, Florida, embarked on construction of a new Amway Center to replace the existing Amway Arena. The new center was designed to host a variety of events such as concerts, arena football, graduation ceremonies, National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball, and the National Basketball Association's (NBA's) Orlando Magic home games. The Amway Center, which opened in October 2010, had a capacity of 19,000 patrons for NBA games. The Amway Center was adjacent to Interstate 4 and State Road 408 in the downtown core. To prepare for the Amway Center's event management challenges, the City of Orlando's Transportation Engineering Department utilized smart event traffic management techniques, which integrated the following system and plan components: intelligent transportation system infrastructure (software and hardware), traffic control device upgrades, regional planning efforts, and state-of-the-art safety and security protocols. These components also helped minimize the environmental impacts of traffic congestion. When designing smart event plans, it is important to consider high-threshold events such as the NBA All-Star Game for system performance and to understand the balance required for operational efficiency and security in today's global climate. In addition, infrastructure performance is critical during high-profile events so that the local economy can benefit and the municipality can stay competitive to attract more of these types of events. Finally, the resultant operational efficiency is vital for reducing the carbon footprint and negative societal impacts.","Consoli, FA, Rogers, J, Al-Deek, H, Tatari, O, Alomari, A",1,Floridablanca; Orlando,COL; USA,10.3141/2396-12,SRID=4326;POINT (-73.08644 7.06222); SRID=4326;POINT (-81.37924 28.53834),252267; 270934,Smart Event Traffic Management: Impact on the Central Florida Regional Transportation Network and Lessons Learned,2013

The current carbon footprint of the global aluminum industry is estimated at 500 million metric tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq), representing about 1.7% of global emissions from all sources. For the global aluminum industry, carbon neutrality is defined as a state where the total ""in-use"" CO2eq saved from all products in current use, including incremental process efficiency improvements, recycling, and urban mining activities, equals the CO2eq expended to produce the global output of aluminum. This paper outlines an integrated and quantifiable plan for achieving ""carbon neutrality"" in the global aluminum industry by advocating five actionable steps: (1) increase use of ""green"" electrical energy grid by 8%, (2) reduce process energy needs by 16%, (3) deploy 35% of products in ""in-use"" energy saving applications, (4) divert 6.1 million metric tonnes/year from landfills, and (5) mine 4.5 million metric tonnes/year from aluminum-rich ""urban mines."" Since it takes 20 times more energy to make aluminum from bauxite ore than to recycle it from scrap, the global aluminum industry could set a reasonable, self-imposed energy/carbon neutrality goal to incrementally increase the supply of recycled aluminum by at least 1.05 metric tonnes for every tonne of incremental production via primary aluminum smelter capacity. Furthermore, the aluminum industry can and should take a global leadership position by actively developing internationally accepted and approved carbon footprint credit protocols.","Das, S",6,Toyota,JPN,10.1007/s11837-012-0237-0,SRID=4326;POINT (137.15 35.08333),362383,Achieving Carbon Neutrality in the Global Aluminum Industry,2012
1411,WOS:000335944500003,"Building energy modelling is often used in US home energy audits to assess a home's energy performance and to determine energy-efficiency retrofit recommendations. These models promise quantitative, engineering-based, defensible information on a home's energy retrofit opportunities. Modelling is based on assumed standard use behaviours, despite highly variable energy use practices. This research reports on tests that incorporate household behaviour in home energy audit modelling, based on a sample of single-family households that received a utility-sponsored home energy audit in Seattle, Washington, a US city with a cool temperate climate. The use of a compact set of self-reported behaviours in place of standardized behavioural assumptions improved the match between actual home energy consumption and model estimates, and shifted retrofit savings predictions. These were modest improvements over the initially poor match, but highlight the opportunity for better customizing home energy audit modelling by using simple information on household behaviours. A comparison of modelled savings of heating-related conservation actions shows that energy savings from moderate behavioural changes are on par with retrofits for many homes. These steps provide a gateway to modelling household behavioural changes alongside retrofits, and a means to bring behaviour into conversations with homeowners and into the technically oriented efficiency paradigm in general.",,11,"Washington, D.C.; Seattle",USA; USA,10.1080/09613218.2014.890776,SRID=4326;POINT (-77.03637000000001 38.89511); SRID=4326;POINT (-122.33207 47.60621),601723; 684451,Better home energy audit modelling: incorporating inhabitant behaviours,2014
1412,WOS:000355043600070,"Cool roofs reflect sunlight and therefore can reduce cooling energy use in buildings. Further, since roofs typically cover about 20-25% of a city, widespread deployment of cool roofs could mitigate the urban heat island effect and partially counter urban temperature increases associated with global scale climate change. The magnitude of these potential benefits for a given city depends on the increase in albedo that can be achieved using reflective roofs. Assessing this increase requires knowledge of roof albedo at the city scale, which until now has been hindered, by a lack of reflectance data with sufficient spatial coverage, spatial resolution, and spectral detail. In this work we use multiband aerial imagery to derive the albedos of individual roofs in seven California cities: Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego, Bakersfield, Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose. The radiometrically calibrated, remotely sensed imagery has high spatial resolution (1 m) and four narrowband reflectances: blue, green, red, and near-infrared. First, we locate roof pixels within GIS building outlines. Next, we use laboratory measurements of the solar spectral reflectances of 190 roofing products to empirically relate broadband solar reflectance to reflectances in the four narrow bands; this empirical relationship well predicts solar reflectance, as indicated by a low root-mean-square of the residuals of 0.016. Albedos computed from remotely sensed reflectances are calibrated to ground measurements of roof albedo in each city. The error (accuracy) at 90% confidence interval of the calibrated albedos is found to vary by city, from 0.00-0.01 at low albedo and 0.06-0.14 at high albedo. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The LCP/IRP strategy employed is based on the regulatory practice in Germany, also with regard to liberalization issues. Furthermore, emphasis is given to the adequate modelling of demand-side management (DSM) programmes, including their effects on electricity generation, capacity expansion and electricity purchase. The results show that selected DSM programmes in the household sector lead to a cost-effective reduction of electricity demand. When ecological considerations, such as a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, are included, the cost of electricity generation increases, as does the potential for DSM savings. However, when a revenue-based approach is used, it is evident that extrinsic economic incentives for DSM need to be given by, for example, regulatory authorities.","Dreher, M, Schoettle, H, Wietschel, M, Fichtner, W, Rentz, O",2,Rottweil; Karlsruhe,DEU; DEU,10.1504/IJEP.1999.002295,SRID=4326;POINT (8.627190000000001 48.16783); SRID=4326;POINT (8.404439999999999 49.00937),25510; 283799,LCP/IRP strategy development using an optimizing energy-emission model,1999
1414,WOS:000380276700005,"The assumption that climate mitigation can only be afforded at a particular level of income is implicit in global climate negotiations. This suggests that middle-income countries may reach a tipping point in their development process where low-carbon investment becomes more viable. In order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, this tipping point needs to be brought forward in time: upper-middle-income countries are already responsible for 37.8% of global CO2 emissions. We explore the scope for large-scale investment in climate mitigation in Johor Bahru, a fast-growing industrial city in Malaysia. We find that the city could reduce per capita emissions by 10.0% by 2025, relative to 2014 levels, through cost-effective investments. If the returns could be recovered and reinvested in low-carbon measures, Johor Bahru could reduce per capita emissions by 35.2% by 2025, relative to 2014 levels. This result suggests that the tipping point may be a function of political will and institutional capacity as well as income. This has substantial implications for global climate policy discussions, particularly the opportunities and responsibilities of middle-income countries. If comparable savings can be delivered across cities in middle-income countries, this would equate to a reduction in global emissions of 6.3% with the exploitation of cost-effective options and 11.3% with the exploitation of cost-neutral options.

In the global move towards a low-carbon society, industrial port cities are emblematic of complex and integrated socio-ecological systems, which are experiencing transition processes related to interactions between bio-geo-physical components and governance. Using a socio-ecological system framework, this article provides insights into innovative regional eco-industrial development strategies for moving toward a low-carbon future in industrial port areas. Based on three case studies (Marseille-Fos in France, Ningbo in China, and Ulsan in South Korea), our analysis focuses on the changing relationships between energy, land cover, time use, and governance. The historical socio-ecological transition of industrial port cities is described as a stepwise process of spatial and functional disconnection/connection of port industrial complexes, which decouple/combine the port city's metabolism from local resources. We highlight the impacts of globalization on port-city socio-ecological trends, describing the effects of the integration of port cities into global economic processes, the impact of global awareness on global environmental changes, and the accelerating pace of change. We compare low-carbon strategies, revealing similarities in terms of conversion toward low carbon sources and growing connectedness and functional diversity of port-industrial systems.

A system dynamics model was developed in this study using STELLA platform to model the energy consumption and CO2 emission trends for the City of Beijing over 2005-2030. Results show that the total energy demand in Beijing is predicted to reach 114.30 million tonnes coal equivalent (Mtce) by 2030, while that value in 2005 is 55.99 Mtce, which is 1.04 times higher than the level in 2005. Accordingly, the total CO2 emissions in 2030 will reach 169.67 million tonnes CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2-eq), 0.43 times higher than that of 2005. The change of energy structure from carbon rich fuel as coal to low-carbon fuel as natural gas will play a very essential role in carbon emission reduction activities of Beijing. The modeling results also shows that the service sector will gradually replace the industrial dominant status in energy consumption as the largest energy consuming sector, followed by industrial and transport sector.

1421,WOS:000406753600005,"Background: It is now universally acknowledged that climate change constitutes a major threat to human health. At the same time, some of the measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, so-called climate change mitigation measures, have significant health co-benefits (e.g., walking or cycling more; eating less meat). The goal of limiting global warming to 1,5 degrees Celsius set by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in 2015 can only be reached if all stakeholders, including households, take actions to mitigate climate change. Results on whether framing mitigation measures in terms of their health co-benefits increases the likelihood of their implementation are inconsistent. The present study protocol describes the transdisciplinary project HOPE (HOuseholds' Preferences for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in four European high-income countries) that investigates the role of health co-benefits in households' decision making on climate change mitigation measures in urban households in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Methods: HOPE employs a mixed-methods approach combining status-quo carbon footprint assessments, simulations of the reduction of households' carbon footprints, and qualitative in-depth interviews with a subgroup of households. Furthermore, a policy analysis of current household oriented climate policies is conducted. In the simulation of the reduction of households' carbon footprints, half of the households are provided with information on health co-benefits of climate change mitigation measures, the other half is not. Households' willingness to implement the measures is assessed and compared in between-group analyses of variance. Discussion: This is one of the first comprehensive mixed-methods approaches to investigate which mitigation measures households are most willing to implement in order to reach the 1,5 degrees target set by the Paris Agreement, and whether health co-benefits can serve as a motivator for households to implement these measures. The comparison of the empirical data with current climate policies will provide knowledge for tailoring effective climate change mitigation and health policies.","Herrmann, A, Fischer, H, Amelung, D, Litvine, D, Aall, C, Andersson, C, Baltruszewicz, M, Barbier, C, Bruyere, S, Benevise, F, Dubois, G, Louis, VR, Nilsson, M, Moberg, KR, Skold, B, Sauerborn, R",2,Paris,FRA,10.1186/s12889-017-4604-1,SRID=4326;POINT (2.3488 48.85341),2138551,Household preferences for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in four European high-income countries: Does health information matter?

1422,WOS:000366364600001,"Background: Public health is often affected by societal decisions that are not primarily about health. Climate change mitigation requires intensive actions to minimise greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Many of these actions take place in cities due to their traffic, buildings, and energy consumption. Active climate mitigation policies will also, aside of their long term global impacts, have short term local impacts, both positive and negative, on public health. Our main objective was to develop a generic open impact model to estimate health impacts of emissions due to heat and power consumption of buildings. In addition, the model should be usable for policy comparisons by non-health experts on city level with city-specific data, it should give guidance on the particular climate mitigation questions but at the same time increase understanding on the related health impacts and the model should follow the building stock in time, make comparisons between scenarios, propagate uncertainties, and scale to different levels of detail. We tested The functionalities of the model in two case cities, namely Kuopio and Basel. We estimated the health and climate impacts of two actual policies planned or implemented in the cities. The assessed policies were replacement of peat with wood chips in co-generation of district heat and power, and improved energy efficiency of buildings achieved by renovations. Results: Health impacts were not large in the two cities, but also clear differences in implementation and predictability between the two tested policies were seen. Renovation policies can improve the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, but this requires systematic policy sustained for decades. In contrast, fuel changes in large district heating facilities may have rapid and large impacts on emissions. However, the life cycle impacts of different fuels is somewhat an open question. Conclusions: In conclusion, we were able to develop a practical model for city-level assessments promoting evidence-based policy in general and health aspects in particular. Although all data and code is freely available, implementation of the current model version in a new city requires some modelling skills.","Tuomisto, JT, Niittynen, M, Parjala, E, Asikainen, A, Perez, L, Trueb, S, Jantunen, M, Kunzli, N, Sabel, CE",1,Kuopio; Basel,FIN; CHE,10.1186/s12940-015-0082-z,SRID=4326;POINT (27.67703 62.89238); SRID=4326;POINT (7.57327 47.55839),89104; 164488,Building-related health impacts in European and Chinese cities: a scalable assessment method,2015
1423,WOS:000262723300009,"The winter stress syndrome hypothesis proposes that the combination of winter conditions and contaminant exposure reduces overwinter survival in juvenile fishes, mainly due to increased depletion of stored energy (lipids). To test this hypothesis in the field, juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) were collected from three exposure sites along Junction Creek, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, representing cumulative inputs from metal mining and municipal wastewater. Overwinter survival potential was determined through measurements of growth (length, weight, muscle RNA/DNA ratio, muscle proteins) and energy stores (whole body triglycerides) in fish collected just prior to and following the overwinter period. We hypothesized that fish collected from exposure sites would exhibit reduced growth and energy storage compared to reference fish in both fall and spring, and that fish from all sites would exhibit reduced energy storage in spring compared to the previous fall. Whole body Se concentrations were elevated (11-42 mu g/g dry wt) in juvenile fathead minnows and white sucker collected at two exposure sites in comparison to fish collected from the reference site (3-6 mu g/g dry wt). In contrast to our hypothesis, fathead minnows were larger with greater triglyceride stores at exposure sites compared to the reference site. White suckers were smaller at exposure sites but did not differ in triglycerides among sites. Overall, the results in these fish species exposed to metal mining and municipal wastewaters do not support the winter stress syndrome hypothesis.

This study aimed to assess the impacts of atmospheric pressure and relative humidity on mortality in Guangzhou, China. Methods This study included 213,737 registered deaths during 2003-2011 in Guangzhou, China. A quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to assess the effects of atmospheric pressure/relative humidity. Results We found significant effect of low atmospheric pressure/relative humidity on mortality. There was a 1.79% (95% confidence interval: 0.38%-3.22%) increase in non-accidental mortality and a 2.27% (0.07%-4.51%) increase in cardiovascular mortality comparing the 5th and 25th percentile of atmospheric pressure. A 3.97% (0.67%-7.39%) increase in cardiovascular mortality was also observed comparing the 5th and 25th percentile of relative humidity. Women were more vulnerable to decrease in atmospheric pressure and relative humidity than men. Age and education attainment were also potential effect modifiers. Furthermore, low atmospheric pressure and relative humidity increased temperature-related mortality. Conclusion Both low atmospheric pressure and relative humidity are important risk factors of mortality. Our findings would be helpful to develop health risk assessment and climate policy interventions that would better protect vulnerable subgroups of the population.","Ou, CQ, Yang, J, Ou, QQ, Liu, HZ, Lin, GZ, Chen, PY, Qian, J, Guo, YM",7,Guangzhou,CHN,10.3967/bes2014.132,SRID=4326;POINT (113.25 23.11667),11071424,"The Impact of Relative Humidity and Atmospheric Pressure on Mortality in Guangzhou, China",2014

Although the Sydney urban area was used as the focus of the case study, the estimated impacts of changing freight vehicle operations across the urban area, via vehicle technologies, infrastructure improvements, logistic and land use changes are expected to be generally applicable to Australian cities and potentially applicable to cities elsewhere. This paper presents the results of a case study analysing and evaluating the impacts of a selection of greenhouse gas abatement measures on the emission and dispersion of benzene and 1,3-butadiene in Inner Sydney, the heart of the Sydney metropolitan area. The results discussed cover three demonstration days in February 1997, and are indicative of the type of policy measures that will produce the required reduction in pollution concentration for the air toxics. The results indicate that there were significant differences in the relative impacts of policies for different parts of the urban area. This is a useful finding since it suggests that specific policies could be targeted to give better air quality in places with significant health concerns such as high asthma, or areas with a greater proportion of the population vulnerable to respiratory conditions, such as children or the elderly.

In this paper, the significant effect of the deterioration of urban microclimate on air-conditioning energy consumption (ACEC) is studied. Cumulative effect (CE) has enormous influence on ACEC and it can also strengthen the influence of urban heat island effect (UHIE), which has not been recognized by previous literatures. UHIE, temperature and humidity effect (THE) and CE are taken into consideration via revising perceived temperature to precisely estimate ACEC caused by urban microclimate. The result shows the ACEC estimated in this paper is much larger than that reported in previous literatures. Our study shows electric ACEC resulting from the comprehensive influence of microclimate accounted for 11.28% of total summer electricity consumption and this percentage reached 20.4% during the peak load period in Beijing in 2005. In turn, the increased ACEC contributes to the increase of urban heat island intensity.

1428,WOS:000389321500034,"Temperatures in cities are amplified through the urban heat island effect by anthropogenic heat emissions into microclimates. The trapping of solar energy in urban canyons plays the most significant role. Our analysis, however, considers how urban air conditioning systems influence their local microclimate. Using models and simple observations we demonstrate how the heat rejected from these machines creates a direct feedback on the machine performance. Thermodynamically, the temperature of the environment directly controls the efficiency of the common refrigeration cycle found in air conditioning systems via the second law. A city, with its complex topography of urban canyons and skyscrapers, produces small microclimates with varying temperatures. This project investigates three urban settings that create microclimates that are detrimental for the efficiency of cooling in New York. First, the overall urban heat island effect, second the effect of roof temperature on rooftop package air conditioning units, and third the impact of local heat emission from agglomerations of window air conditioners. The efficiency loss is investigated by considering the range of temperature changes that can be observed in the surrounding environment of air conditioning systems, and determining the subsequent impact on the Coefficient of Performance (COP). Our COP analyses indicate a range of potential energy increases of around 7%-47% due to increases in environmental temperature around air conditioners. An analysis of the building stock of New York City showed that the annual electrical energy demand is potentially increased by these effects by nearly 10 PJ (3000 GWh) combined, which is more than 10% of the total cooling demand for the city.

Twenty years of industrial symbiosis research has provided ample evidence and experience how to close material and energy cycles in industrial systems. The more recent urban symbiosis literature develops a similar perspective and experience on closing waste resource cycles for a different social system: cities. An urban symbiosis analysis on how to close urban waste resource cycles has to focus on geographical boundaries, local partnerships, and policy interventions. In conducting a detailed case study of Rotterdam Energy Approach and Planning (REAP), this paper aims to identify how urban actors, notably local authorities, can facilitate improved urban resource management to mitigate climate change. REAP incorporates energy and water reuse in an urban area, using by-products as resources in different urban functions. It is coordinated by Rotterdam's local authority, in partnership with architects and academic institutions in its design, and housing corporations and energy companies in its implementation. The methodology to assess REAP includes a review of policy documents, site visits and in-depth interviews. This study revealed the central role of local authorities in governing urban symbiosis projects like REAP; the need for increased private-sector participation in the design stage of such projects; and the necessity to encourage dialogue, learning and flexibility in the governance of urban resource management.

Indeed, mainly for heating dominated climates, usually there is a great attention to the design of measures for reducing the energy losses in winter, while the summer comfort often is secondary or neglected. On the other hand, just where the warm season is not so hard, passive energy measures have to be deeply exploited, in order to avoid the installation of air-conditioning systems, with positive effects on both the building and city scales (e.g., the reduction of urban heat islands).

Urban residential energy consumption is a valuable place to start reducing emissions, and urban tree planting programs have been both proposed and utilized as an energy conservation mechanism. Home energy savings associated with urban trees are often quantified using models because of the many complex interactions among variables that can influence home energy use. However, recent empirical analyses have found that energy savings associated with trees may be minimal relative to other important factors like building characteristics and human behaviors. We surveyed 176 residents from four neighborhoods in Raleigh, NC with varying socio-economic characteristics to assess relationships between summer energy usage, tree cover, homeowner behavior, and building characteristics. As hypothesized, we found that building characteristics, demographics, and human behaviors were all significant variables in describing the variability in summertime home energy usage. Although, total percent tree cover 18 m around the home did not affect summertime energy use, the number of trees in the NE and NW quadrants around each household did predict home energy use. These results indicate that planting trees may not be a successful strategy for reducing energy use from the residential sector in the heavily forested Southeast; rather efforts should target conservation and efficiency.","Nelson, C, McHale, MR, Peterson, MN",4,Raleigh,USA,10.1007/s11252-012-0246-3,SRID=4326;POINT (-78.63861 35.7721),451066,Influences of landscape and lifestyle on home energy consumption,2012

Particular emphasis is put on the operation phase (Tank-to Wheel, TTW) of the city buses using the Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR). The simulations are based on real-world driving patterns collected from Curitiba, comprising 42 driving cycles that represent city bus operation on seven BRT routes with six operation times for each. Hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric two-axle city buses use 30% and 75% less WTW fossil energy per distance compared to a conventional two-axle city bus (19.46 MJ(fossil),(WTW)/km). This gives an absolute reduction of 1115 gCO(2)e,(WTW)/km in WTW GHG emissions when operating a plug-in hybrid-electric city bus instead of a conventional two-axle city bus (1539 gCO(2)e,(WTW)/km). However, a conventional bi-articulated city bus can be environment-friendlier than hybrid electric city buses in terms of WTW fossil energy use and WTW GHG emissions per passenger distance, if its passenger capacity is sufficiently utilised. Nonetheless, the plug-in hybrid-electric city bus remains the most energy-efficient and less polluting option. Hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric powertrains offer the possibility to achieve much higher levels of decarbonisation in the BRT system in Curitiba than the blending mandate of 7%(vol) biodiesel into diesel implemented in Brazil in 2016. In addition, the simulations show that TTW energy use can considerably vary by up to 77% between different operation times, BRT routes and types of city buses.

The historical annual data show that UHI intensification is responsible for similar to 1/3 of the total warming the city has experienced since 1900. The intensification correlates with a significant drop in windspeed over the century, likely due to an increase in the urban boundary layer as Manhattan's extensive skyline development unfolded. For the current-day, using 2002 data, we calculate the hourly and seasonal strength of the city's UHI for five different case study areas, including sites in Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn. We find substantial intra-city variation (similar to 2 degrees C) in the strength of the hourly UHI, with some locations showing daytime cool islands - i.e., temperatures lower than the average of the distant non-urban stations, while others, at the same time, show daytime heat islands. The variations are not easily explained in terms of land surface characteristics such as building stock, population, vegetation fraction or radiometric surface temperatures from remote sensing. Although it has been suggested that stations within urban parks will underestimate UHI, the Central Park station does not show a significant underestimate, except marginally during summer nights.

Cities with high CPII (Comprehensive Popularity Intensity Indicator) values are not always clustered in the three main economic regions but are located dispersedly. This implies that cities can make great progresses in low carbon development irrespective of their economic levels and spatial locations. Three cities (Shuangyashan, Chongzuo and Guyuan) had zero PPI, WPI and CPII values, reflecting that they have not been considered for low carbon development by the scientific community or the public. It is obvious that some cities have been ignored in the context of low carbon development or they have not taken any initiatives with respect to low carbon development. The CPII used in this paper could be a useful indicator for monitoring and evaluating the perception of low carbon development at the city level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1440,WOS:000425520200029,"We propose a new application of inexpensive light-emitting diode (LED)-based Sun photometers, consisting of measuring the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) with high resolution within metropolitan scales. Previously, these instruments have been used at continental scales by the GLOBE program, but this extension is already covered by more expensive and higher-precision instruments of the AERONET global network. For this we built an open source two-channeled LED-based Sun photometer based on previous developments, with improvements in the hardware, software, and modifications on the calibration procedure. Among these we highlight the use of MODTRAN to characterize the effect introduced by using LED sensors in the AOT retrieval, an open design available for the scientific community and a calibration procedure that takes advantage of a CIMEL Sun photometer located within the city, enables the intercomparison of several LED Sun photometers with a common reference. We estimated the root-mean-square error in the AOT retrieved by the prototypes as 0.006 at the 564nm and 0.009 at the 408nm. This error is way under the magnitude of the AOT daily cycle variability measured by us in our campaigns, even for distances closer than 15km. In addition to inner city campaigns, we also show aerosol-tracing applications by measuring AOT variations from the city of Santiago to the Andes glaciers. Measuring AOT at high spatial resolution in urban areas can improve our understanding of urban scale aerosol circulation, providing information for solar energy planning, health policies, and climatological studies, among others.",,0,Santiago,CHL,10.1002/2017JD027309,SRID=4326;POINT (-70.64827 -33.45694),4837295,AOT Retrieval Procedure for Distributed Measurements With Low-Cost Sun Photometers,2018
1441,WOS:000248509000016,"Objectives: This paper was aimed at examining the relationship between meteorological variables and bacillary dysentery in different climatic and geographic areas in China. Methods: Jinan in northern China, with a temperate climate, and Baoan in southern China, with a subtropical climate were chosen as study areas. Spearman correlations and seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were used to quantify the association between meteorological variables and dysentery. The Hockey Stick model was used to explore the threshold of the effect of temperatures. Results: Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and air pressure were significantly correlated with the incidence of dysentery in the both cities, with tag effects varying from zero to two months. In the SARIMA models, maximum and minimum temperatures were significantly associated with dysentery transmission. The thresholds for the effects of maximum and minimum temperatures were 17 degrees C and 8 degrees C, respectively, in the northern city. No thresholds were detected in the southern city. Conclusions: Climate variations have different impacts on the transmission of bacillary dysentery in temperate and subtropical cities in China. Public health action should be taken at this stage to reduce future risks of climate change with consideration of local climatic conditions.

Research shows that informal settlements are at high risk from natural hazards and the effects of global climate change. Conditions within such settlements are diverse, however, and it is important that we understand the variation in risk across households. In this paper, we study the uneven terrain of risk to localized hazards in informal settlements in Kolkata, India. Our research question is, which factors predict household exposure to monsoon rain hazards? We surveyed 414 households living in low-lying informal settlements on the city's periphery. Using a variety of predictors, we estimate binary logistic models for two outcome variables tied to monsoon rain: home flooding and home leaking. We find that household exposure varies significantly across our study population and follows predictable patterns based on socio-economic and infrastructure variables. The home flooding model results show that households with higher incomes are less likely to flood, but in situ births increase exposure. Households living in structures made of more permanent materials are less likely to flood, as are households living near infrastructure. The home leaking model shows that households with relative financial stability are less likely to leak, as are those that have been living in the settlement for longer periods of time and whose houses are made of better quality materials. These findings indicate that extensive risk in informal settlements is unevenly experienced and that policies intended to reduce disaster and climate risk should focus on the lowest-income households, the provision of infrastructure, and security of tenure.",,4,Kolkata,IND,10.1007/s11069-016-2599-z,SRID=4326;POINT (88.36304 22.56263),4631392,Predictors of household exposure to monsoon rain hazards in informal settlements,2017
1443,WOS:000307615200018,"SE Anatolia hosts the most important oilfields and asphaltite deposits in Turkey. Here, we report on the organic geochemical characteristics of crude oil samples from four wells (Yolacan-1,.Camurlu-28, B. Kozluca-22 and D. Sinirtepe-1) located to the west of Mardin city, one oil from a well (Ozluce-1) to the north of Batman city, and asphaltite samples from the Avgamasya. Herbol and Seridahle localities. Reservoir rocks for the oils from the Ozluce-1 Camurlu-28, B. Kozluca-22 and D. Smirtepe-1 wells are Lower Cretaceous limestones and dolomites of the Alt Sinan Formation. At well Yolacan-1, the oil is reservoired in the carbonates of the Lower Cretaceous Mardin Group. At Avgamasya and Seridahle, asphaltites occur in joint systems in the Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene Germav Formation; the Herbol asphaltites are located in the Eocene Gercus Formation. Except for the Seridahle asphaltite sample, delta C-13 values of all other oils and asphaltites are very similar. Gas chromatograms indicate that while the Ozluce-1 oil sample predominantly contains n-alkanes with medium carbon number (C-13-C-20) the other oil samples predominantly contain n-alkanes with low carbon number (C-4-C-11). Except for the Ozluce-1 oil sample, all the other oil and asphaltite samples show similar C-27. C-29 and C-29 sterane distributions, with C-29 being the dominant sterane. Based on the C-28/C-29 sterane ratio, the Ozluce-1 oil derives from a younger source when compared to the other oil and asphaltites. The diasterane/sterane, Ts/(Ts+Tm). C-29/C-30 hopane ratios and C-24 tetracylic terpane abundance indicate that all the oil and asphaltite samples are of similar character except for the Ozluce-1 oil sample, which is characterized by higher diasterane/sterane and Ts/(Ts+Tm) ratios, a lower C-29/C-30 hopane value and lower C-24 tetracylic terpane content. The C-31-R/C-30 ratio indicates a marine source for all oil and asphaltite samples. Normal alkane, isoprenoid, biomarker and isotope data indicate that the all the crude oils (with the exception of that from Ozluce-1) and all the asphaltites are geochemically similar and were generated from marine carbonate source rocks. The Ozluce-1 appears to have been derived from a clay-rich source rock. Based on geology of the basin and their geochemical characteristics, it is suggested that all oils (except Ozluce-1) and asphaltites were generated from Triassic-Jurassic carbonates of the Cudi Group. The source rock of Ozluce-1 oil may be Cretaceous marl or limestone of the Karababa Formation or clay-rich limestone of the Beloka Formation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the airflow and thermal comfort in six different designs of wind catchers using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Simulations of airflow in the wind catcher and the building were done under steady state and turbulent flow regime with boundary conditions based on typical conditions found in Yazd city, Iran. Several commonly used turbulence models were evaluated to assess the accuracy of the simulation. First, the proposed CFD model was validated through comparison of wind tunnel data available in the literature, and then the model was used for design purposes. It was found that the k-omega turbulence model can accurately predict the airflow velocity in the range of parameters studied. The design and performance of wind catcher were evaluated based on the thermal comfort levels using the Center for the Built Environment (CBE) thermal comfort tool and numerical data. Width and height of the wind catcher were varied in the simulations and optimal values were determined. It was found that varying the width of the wind catcher had the greatest impact on the airflow speed and distribution inside the room. Reducing the width from 2.5 m to 2 m showed that airflow velocity in the middle area was increased up to 34%. While reducing the width from 2 m to 1.5 m showed an entirely different flow pattern inside the building and also increase airflow speed in the middle area up to 50%. The addition of curved wall at the bottom of the inlet channel showed that it could increase the airflow speed of the inflow stream, however, it also caused the airflow to be directed towards the lower levels of the room and very large rotating flows in the upper levels. Finally, the results showed that the wind catcher may be optimized for improving comfort for various climates using the tools presented in this work. (C) 2016 International Energy Initiative.

1446,WOS:000260197100005,"Continually increasing amounts of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the limited capacity of the existing waste management system in Phuket have led to the consideration of integrated waste management system (IWMS). Life cycle assessment (LCA) was employed to compare the greenhouse gas emissions expressed as global warming potential (GWP) of the existing waste management system (the base scenario) and other three IWMSs for Phuket MSW. Besides incineration and landfilling, the proposed scenarios include 30% source separation for recycling (scenario 2), anaerobic digestion (scenario 3) and both (scenario 4). The functional unit is set as 1 t of Phuket MSW treated. Results from the impact assessment of the base scenario shows that the net GWP is 1006 kg CO2 equivalent. Landfilling contributes to the highest potentials of this impact. The results from a holistic comparison show that scenario 4 is the best option among all the scenarios, contributing GWP of 415 kg CO2 eq., whereas the base scenario is the worst. The emission of greenhouse gas from landfilling is reduced by the introduction of landfill gas recovery and utilization for electricity production. By assumption, 50% recovery of landfill gas leads to the GWP reduction around 58% by total GWP of landfilling and 36% by the net GWP of the whole system in the base scenario. The study suggests that a policy that promotes source separation should be pursued, preferably combined with the application of landfill gas recovery for electricity. Policy promoting recycling is favorable over anaerobic digestion in the situation that both treatment systems could not be established at the same time. The major conclusion from the study is that results from the LCA can support Phuket Municipality for decision-making with respect to planning and optimizing IWMS. It can benefit other municipalities or policy makers to apply in their waste management projects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

1447,WOS:000375629900006,"This paper compares the different ways in which the cities of Hamburg and Rotterdam are taking preemptive action to adapt to climate change. Literature, interviews, secondary data, official statistics, project reports and policy briefs were used to identify institutional arrangements used by the city governments to encourage innovations in climate adaptation strategies and involve the private sector in climate change policy implementation. We focus on cases that create positive opportunities; exploring how innovations are facilitated within the theoretical frameworks of the Porter hypothesis and eco-innovation. We examine two possible pathways of climate change governance, firstly strict regulation and formal enforcement, and secondly institutional eco-innovation and voluntary measures. We found that different emphasis is placed on the preferred pathway in each of the case studies. Hamburg focuses on formal enforcements while the Rotterdam city government encourages institutional eco-innovation by acting as a platform and also providing incentives. Our findings suggest that a well-designed institutional framework can enhance innovation and increase environmental and business performance. The framework could vary in instruments and patterns, using both formal constraints and incentives to increase voluntary actions to shape policy. The formal rules could be stringent or incentivising to shape the climate change measures. The research aims to contribute to both practice and science by providing examples that might motivate and inspire other cities to design appropriate institutions for climate change policy implementation.

This study explores how differences in local conditions and among citizens within and across Mumbai, India shape local infrastructure (e.g. energy, water, transport) and environmental (e.g. managing pollution, climate-related extreme weather events) policy priorities for change that may or may not be aligned with local government action or global environmental sustainability concerns such as low-carbon development. In this rapidly urbanizing city, multiple issues compete for prominence, ranging from improved management of pollution and extreme weather to energy and other infrastructure services. To inform a broader perspective of policy priorities for urban development and risk mitigation, a survey was conducted among over 1200 citizens. The survey explored the state of local conditions, the challenges citizens face, and the ways in which differences in local conditions (socio-institutional, infrastructure, and health-related) demonstrate inequities and influence how citizens perceive risks and rank priorities for the future design and implementation of local planning, policy, and community-based efforts. With growing discussion and tensions surrounding the new urban sustainable development goal, announced by the UN in late September 2015, and a new global urban agenda document to be agreed upon at 'Habitat III', issues on whether sustainable urbanization priorities should be set at the international, national or local level remain controversial. As such, this study aims to first understand determinants of and variations in local priorities across one city, with implications discussed for local-to-global urban sustainability. Findings from survey results indicate the determinants and variation in conditions such as age, assets, levels of participation in residential action groups, the health outcome of chronic asthma, and the infrastructure service of piped water provision to homes are significant in shaping the top infrastructure and environmental policy priorities that include water supply and sanitation, air pollution, waste, and extreme heat.

We employ a case study of Philadelphia, the first city in the United States to attempt an entirely green approach to meeting federal regulations to examine issues of governance that emerged and how they were addressed. The case study draws on interviews with fourteen public and private sector actors involved in implementation, a site visit to observe the installations and to discuss the approach with a key planner, and grey literature. We find that silos can be broken down and that if open communications and a willingness to change practices are present, obstacles cited in the literature can be overcome. The key implication is that the three elements of governance need to be built into the green infrastructure planning process.

1451,WOS:000221095000014,"Roundput [Int. J. Sustainable Dev. World Ecol. 8 (2001) 29] is one of the most important principles of the development of both natural and industrial ecosystems, and is especially important for analysis of an ecosystem's dynamics and overall functioning. as it is related to an extent to which energy and matter are recycled and used in a cascade-type operation. Here we argue. using two modelling case studies from the UK and Switzerland, that increasing recycling rates for plastic and glass would improve the energy budget of waste management programmes, and, therefore, benefit the corresponding industrial ecosystems. In the first case study we show that the major source of energy savings from glass recycling is through increased use of cullet in glass manufacture (5.4% reduction in total energy consumption with 100% glass recycling when compared to the present-day situation). In terms of energy consumption, recycling is the preferred waste management option, even if a large proportion of the recycled glass is diverted for use as aggregates. Further energy savings could be achieved by introduction of a city-wide kerbside collection scheme, which would result in an estimated maximum reduction (100% recycling rate) of 7.6% in energy consumption for processing of the Southampton household glass wastes. In the second case study we compare the situation in which all wastes are burnt at a MSWI plant with two scenarios assuming that 8.1 % of the plastic is diverted into a cement Kiln (mixed plastics; scenario 1) or a mechanical recycling plant (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene; scenario 2). The resulting net primary energy consumption values for both scenario 1 (5.85E8 MJ or 60% relative to the reference scenario) and 2 (7.46E8 MJ or 76.6% relative to the reference scenario) use less primary energy than the reference scenario (9.74E8 MJ). This means that, from the point of view of resource consumption, the diversion of plastics waste away from the MSWI plant has a beneficial effect. Therefore, the increased recycling of glass and plastic would benefit the industrial ecosystems in terms of energy savings. This is similar to the patterns observed in most natural ecosystems, and a careful consideration of this similarity within a framework of industrial ecology should help to reduce the conflict between the two systems.

The model system was first applied to simulate a historical photochemical smog episode of two days (January 13-14, 1997) using the 1997 anthropogenic emission database available at the Pollution Control Department and an estimated biogenic emission. The output 1-hr ozone (O-3) for BMR, however, did not meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested performance criteria. The simulated minimum and maximum O-3 values in the domain were much higher than the observations. Multiple model runs with different precursor emission reduction scenarios showed that the best model performance with the simulated 1-hr O-3 meeting all the criteria was obtained when the volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission from mobile source reduced by 50% and carbon monoxide by 20% from the original database.

1455,WOS:000412252400021,"Concrete is a heavyweight construction material whose high thermal mass could increase the thermal storage capacity of a building envelope and in turn affect indoor thermal comfort. Selecting an appropriate method for concrete construction and form could also affect the total energy performance and thermal comfort of a building, a fact that is often overlooked by structural engineers. This study presents the results of energy simulations of the potential impact that concrete construction forms, in particular two slab types, and structural materials have on the energy consumption of archetypal commercial office buildings in five major Australia cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Darwin). This study has three stages: 1) a structural analysis of two slab types (Flat and Waffle slab); 2) the selection of two types of structural concrete (conventional Normal weight concrete and novel Ultra-lightweight concrete); 3) a comparative analysis to quantify the magnitude of the change in predicted annual energy consumption due to changes in the form of construction and the type of structural concrete. The energy simulation results showed that the thermal energy performance of the building was influenced by structural materials and slab types. It is shown that the thermal capacity of the concrete construction forms can be utilized to shift thermal loads, reduce peak demand and reduce operational energy consumption. The selection of an appropriate concrete type was more important in terms of energy performance in the coldest (Melbourne and Canberra) and hottest (Darwin) climate zones of this study.

The chemical concentrations of nineteen elements, two water-soluble ions and TC were measured. The results showed that the levels of particulates and their chemical components were relatively higher in 2010 than those in 2011: for PM10, PM (39%), Si (27%), TC (76%), NO3- (16%), SO42- (19%); for PM2.5, PM (33%), Si (11%), TC (67%), NO3- (32%), SO42- (17%). Ternary diagram analysis, enrichment and other statistical methods were employed to study the spatial and temporal variations of the concentrations of PM and their compositions. Moreover, relative changes (%) of concentrations combined with the relative reported data from statistical yearbook and environmental quality reports are discussed to evaluate the effects of pollution control strategies for different functional regions. Finally, back-trajectory and factor-cluster analysis are proposed as an aid for the discussion of the meteorological influences and the possible source categories. The reduction of crustal dust may be attributed from the influence of long-range air transport. All the methods used above resulted in an overall agreement that showed the pollution control strategies were effective in reducing particulate air pollution: the total carbon (TC) reduction, accounting for 40-49% (PM10) and 35-48% (PM2.5), was mostly attributed to the strategy of banning high-emission yellow-tag vehicles, especially in commercial regions; the reduction of SO2 and NOx emissions had an impact on the sulphate (17.03% for PM10 and 15.37% for PM2.5) and nitrate (12.48% for PM10 and 21.58% for PM2.5) decrease.

This paper identifies diverse data sources to assess GHG emission from community-wide infrastructure footprints (CIF) in four Chinese cities of varying population (1 to 20 million people) and administrative levels: Yixing, Qinhuangdao, Xiamen and Beijing. CIF addresses seven infrastructure sectors providing energy (fuels/coal), electricity, water supply and wastewater treatment, transportation, municipal waste management, construction materials, and food to support urban activities. Industrial energy use dominates the infrastructure GHG CIF in all four cities, ranging from 76% of total CIF in Yixing to 30% in Beijing, followed by residential energy use (6 - 13%), transportation (4 - 12%), commercial energy use (2 - 25%), food (6 - 11%), cement use (3 - 8%) and water (about 1%), thereby identifying priorities for low-carbon infrastructure development. Trans-boundary footprint contributions ranged from 31% (Beijing) to 8% (Qinhuangdao), indicating that supply chains to cities are important. GHGs from energy use are dominated by electricity (35 - 45%) and non-electricity coal use (30 - 50%).

However, this issue has been overlooked to some extent for past decades in China, which led to inappropriate assessments only by measuring pollutant emissions per unit floor area or unit heat supply. In this paper, we present an atmospheric environmental assessment model incorporating the state of the art AERMOD modeling and the concept of normalized population distribution weights (NPDWs) to compute the mean spatial distribution (MSD) of pollutants for qualitatively evaluating the atmospheric environmental impacts of DH. We demonstrate the model in assessing different heating scenarios, characterized by basic heat load ratio in a real-life combined district heating system of Daqing city with a population of 2.7 million. The results show that the presented model and MSD concentrations furnish a better base to assess the atmospheric environmental impact.

The model is based on a mathematical description of the transport system, where transport mode choice follows ideal simple rules based on distance from origin to destination and transit network accessibility. For each transport mode unit energy consumption, capacity and load factor are considered. Flows of trips are optimally assigned between origin and destination zones in such a way that transport energy is minimised. Energy ideally required for home-to-school/university travel is assessed as these journeys contribute a significant number of daily trips within a city. In particular, the model was applied to the urban area of Catania, a medium-sized town in Italy, for different scenarios, including improvements in the transit system and in pedestrian/cycling accessibility.

1460,WOS:000241528300003,"Past research on natural ventilation has revealed that the application of pure natural ventilation systems may be limited in the United States by issues such as climate suitability, humidity control and reliability. However, hybrid (or mixed-mode) ventilation systems offer the possibility of attaining energy savings in a greater number of buildings and climates through the combination of natural ventilation systems with mechanical equipment. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential energy and indoor environmental performance of natural and hybrid ventilation alternatives in low- to mid-rise US commercial buildings in a variety of US climates. In this effort, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reviewed hybrid ventilation approaches and conducted simulations to predict and compare the indoor environmental and energy performance of natural, hybrid, and mechanical systems in an otherwise similar building. Due to the strong interaction of airflow and heat transfer in naturally ventilated buildings, a coupled multi-zone airflow and thermal simulation tool was used to model the systems in a five-story office building in five US cities. Overall, the natural ventilation system performed adequately in San Francisco and Los Angeles, although some tolerance for imperfect thermal and indoor air quality (IAQ) control is required. Natural ventilation system performance was poor in the more challenging climates Of Boston, Minneapolis, and Miami due to poor thermal control, unreliable ventilation, or high heating loads. The hybrid ventilation system improved on the performance of the natural ventilation system in all climates, with dramatic improvements in some. Compared to the mechanical system, the hybrid system saved significant amounts of fan energy, reduced cooling loads, or reduced both fan and cooling loads in all climates but often resulted in higher heating loads: Although the hybrid system provided acceptable thermal control, the mechanical system provided more consistent control, as expected. The hybrid ventilation system provided better IAQ control, as indicated by CO2 concentrations, in most but not all cases.","Emmerich, SJ",17,Minneapolis; Los Angeles; San Francisco,USA; USA; USA,10.1080/10789669.2006.10391447,SRID=4326;POINT (-93.26384 44.97997); SRID=4326;POINT (-118.24368 34.05223); SRID=4326;POINT (-122.41942 37.77493),410939; 3971883; 864816,Simulated performance of natural and hybrid ventilation systems in an office building,2006

In order to perform this analysis, two kinds of energy recovery have been studied: electric energy (electrical configuration) only, and both electric and thermal energy (cogenerative configuration). So after a reconstruction of the economic situation, by considering all the costs and revenues, for both the possible energetic configurations the correspondence between the environmental convenience (that was evaluated in a previously work) and the economic convenience has been defined.

These programs provide a venue for understanding how regulations governing multifamily housing can affect an owner's incentive to make energy efficient investments, and a tenant's desire to reduce their energy consumption levels. This paper empirically tests the impact of subsidized housing regulations on the energy efficiency of multi-family housing for low-income households. We begin by constructing a unique database that integrates actual energy use with physical, socioeconomic, and regulatory characteristics of all large multifamily properties in New York City, focusing on whether a property receives a federal rental subsidy. We employ multivariate regression models to examine the factors that influence energy consumption in multi-family buildings and compare subsidized housing to market-rate housing, controlling for a range of building and household characteristics. We find that subsidized properties are associated with higher energy consumption than similar market-rate properties and, of the subsidized housing programs, Public Housing tends to consume the most energy. Our results suggest that despite the potential for retrofitting multifamily properties, and associated cost, energy, and carbon emissions savings, regulatory factors constrain investment and consumption decisions in the case of subsidized properties.

This study used lifecycle assessment to compare CO2 emissions associated with different decisions by arborists to the amount of CO2 sequestered over 50 years for California sycamore (Platanus racemosa) planted in Los Angeles, CA. Scenarios examined effects of equipment and vehicle choices, different operational efficiencies, amounts of irrigation water applied and the fate of wood residue from pruning and tree removal. For the Highest Emission Case, total emissions (9.002t) exceeded CO2 stored (-7.798 t), resulting in net emissions of 1.204 t. The Lowest Emission Case resulted in net removal of -3.768 t CO2 over the 50-year period. Tree selection and irrigation water management were key leverage points in Los Angeles. Converting residue from the removed tree to wood products resulted in substantially lower net CO2 emissions than did converting it into bioenergy or mulch. Although emissions from vehicles and equipment accounted for less than 6% of the CO2 stored in the tree, substantial reductions are achievable. Arborists can reduce CO2 emissions threefold by converting from high- to low-emitting equipment and vehicles. By reducing travel distances and equipment run-times, twofold emission reductions are possible.

1469,WOS:000418978100044,"This study analyses the influence of Personalized Conditioning (PC) systems for potential savings of energy, cost, and CO2 emissions from commercial buildings in different U.S. cities. This analysis characterizes potential benefits from the deployment of PC systems during peak cooling hours for peak load shifting. PC systems deployed in coordination with the central building air conditioning systems could have a large-scale influence on a city's energy footprint. Specifically, portable PC systems that use Phase Change Materials (PCMs) for heat rejection, allow for heat absorption during the working hours and heat rejection during non-working hours typically coinciding with the off-peak (base) utility rates when the commercial building tend to be unoccupied. However, there are limiting factors for the potential energy and cost savings with the use of PC systems. Therefore, this study assesses the use of PC systems in addition to the existing building air conditioning system during cooling seasons. The assessment entails potential energy end-use savings for 7 major cities located in different geographical/climatic regions of the U.S. Furthermore, the study calculates potential cost savings based on the variations in the peak and off-peak (base) electricity rates for different local Time of Use (TOU) programs. This simulated evaluation of local building systems and utility programs allows for regional various on the city's energy footprint reduction to emerge. The analysis shows that midrise apartments are a better building type than office buildings for the deployment of PC systems during a cooling season. The cash savings per person for the deployment of PC systems for midrise apartments are $62/year, $40/year, and $37/year for Honolulu, NY City, and Phoenix, respectively.

This paper reports on the findings of the VIBAT London study (www.vibat.org) which considers the role of the transport sector in reducing CO2 emissions in London. The analysis develops a transport and carbon simulation model (TC-SIM) for London. Within this, users are able to consider the implementation of a series of potential policy packages-low emission vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimes, public transport, walking and cycling, strategic and local urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and slower speeds, long distance travel substitution, freight transport and international air. They can select variable levels of application to help achieve headline CO2 emission reduction targets. The roles of carbon rationing and oil prices are also considered. TC-SIM can be played in different user modes: as 'free riders', 'techno-optimists', 'enviro-optimists', 'complacent car addicts' and other typical travel market segments, including a 'free role'. Game playing or scenario testing such as this helps to highlight perceived levels of homogeneity of views within certain cohorts, the development of entrenched positions and the likely success in achieving objectives.

Therefore, an optimal energy abatement strategy built on comprehensive information on overall embodied energy consumption is in urgent need. Adopting the three-scale input-output analysis, this study uses Beijing as a case to depict a specific urban economy's overall energy consumption impacted by local direct energy use, domestic and foreign trade. The results show that energy embodied in domestic trade dominated Beijing's energy consumption, while local direct energy is accounting for less than 1/3 of Beijing's total embodied energy consumption. The quantity of energy embodied in imports far exceeds that embodied in exports, making the city a net embodied energy importer and indicating that policies considering direct energy use only will cause energy leakage problem. These findings suggest that the current measures such as displacing energy-intensive sectors to other regions lead to ""local reduction but overall rise"". Moreover, analysis for five abatement scenarios (average, intensity share, absolute share, discriminatory absolute and discriminatory intensity) was carried out to figure out the optimal abatement strategy for Beijing. Due to less loss of potential output, it is found that intensity share scenario is the optimal one among all the scenarios concerned. Analysis in this study suggests that each region should break limits of self-centered perceptions and multi-scale governance for more appropriate responsibility assignment is recommended for overall energy abatement.

1472,WOS:000400199900001,"Buildings need energy including heat and electricity, and both of them can be provided by the solar systems. Solar thermal and photovoltaic systems absorb the solar energy and can supply the heat and electricity for buildings, respectively. However, for the urban residential buildings, the limited available area makes installation of the solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic modules together impossible. A hybrid photovoltaic/thermal system can simultaneously generate heat and electricity, which is deemed to be quite suitable for the urban residential buildings application. And yet, for a rural house of China, the available area for installation of the solar collectors is large but daily domestic hot water demand of a rural family is generally not exceeded 300 L If only the hybrid photovoltaic/thermal collectors are installed on the whole available area, this will lead to an overproduction of the thermal energy, especially in summer. Moreover, buildings requiring for the heat and electricity are different in different regions and different seasons. In this paper, simulation models of the solar thermal, photovoltaic and hybrid photovoltaic/thermal systems are presented, and experiments are also performed to validate the simulation results. Using the validated models, performances of the three solar systems for residential applications were predicted. And energy comparison between the three solar systems used in Hongkong, Lhasa, Shanghai and Beijing of China, respectively, were also studied. Results show that, for the urban residential building with limited available installation space, a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal system may have the largest potential for reducing the energy consumption among the solar thermal, photovoltaic and hybrid photovoltaic/thermal systems. And for a rural house with large available area, system with photovoltaic and hybrid photovoltaic/thermal modules can obtained the most net annual electricity output, and the installation area of the hybrid photovoltaic/thermal collectors mainly depended on the hot water load of the building.

The nitrogen loading rate (NLR) up to 0.227 Kg TN m(-3) d(-1) was tolerated by the elevated AC control level device to assure successful denitrification performances (from 70% to 90%) also in conditions of COD/TN lower than 7. Comparing the AC with the pre AC conditions, a total energy saving in the range of 13-23% was estimated.

The MEEMS (municipal energy and environmental management system) performs the almost inconceivable role of accomplishing prerequisite targets at the national level and, consequently, the European and World levels also. Therefore, a proper infrastructure for MEEMS needs to be effectively applied in order to implement policy initiatives. A novel organisational framework of MEEMS is proposed and is constituted upon three pillars: integration of the municipal metabolism approach, the KBS (knowledge-based system), and the MTIS (municipal technology innovation system). By properly addressing the dynamics of the MEES (municipal energy and environmental system), and the new conceptual organisation of MEEMS, a need for the inclusion of innovative elements can be defined regarding support mechanisms. Integration of the end-user approach defines the fundamental orientation of modern MEEMS. This new concept paves a pathway towards an intelligent energy and environmental system.

This study provides a method to evaluate carbon footprinting for public transport systems in Xiamen city, China across the life cycle. This method, which was based on the life cycle assessment approach including three components - infrastructure, fuels and vehicles - was presented to account the GHG emissions of public transport. The GHG emissions of the two kinds of public transport systems (bus rapid transit [BRT] and normal bus transit [NRT]) in Xiamen City were compared. Results showed that the average carbon emissions of the BRT system was 638.44 gCO(2)e per person, and that of the NBT system was 2,088.38 gCO(2)e. If we only took the direct carbon emissions of fuel consumption in the vehicle operation into consideration, the average carbon emissions were, respectively, approximately 149.08 gCO(2)e per person and 260.84 gCO(2)e per person by BRT and NBT system. The results indicated that the effects of energy saving from the BRT system are better than NBT system, which is related to the features of the BRT system such as large volume, energy-saving and environment-friendly vehicle type and exclusive right-of way.","Cui, SH, Meng, FX, Wang, W, Lin, JY",6,Xiamen,CHN,10.4155/CMT.11.32,SRID=4326;POINT (118.08187 24.47979),3531347,"GHG accounting for public transport in Xiamen city, China",2011

It was observed that, on average, households that adopted only energy efficiency measures did not have a significant reduction in their electricity usage over the long term. However, consistent with expectations, this study did show that there was a significant correlation between the number of energy efficiency measures adopted and the greatest household reduction in electricity usage.

Results show that, compared with 2005, in 2012 (1) interprovincial export caused the largest amount of CO2 emissions [135.5 Mt] with the main contributions arising from manufacturing (42.1 Mt); transportation, storage, and post (TSP in short, 29.1 Mt); and households (23.6 Mt); (2) across the intermediate input-output system, real estate activities accounted for the largest amount of embodied CO2 intensity (0.07 kg per yuan) and more sectors outsourced CO2; (3) tracing the integrated sector network, CO2 linkages pointed to manufacturing and TSP dominating the internal linkages, manufacturing prominent in mixed linkages, secondary industry leading the net forward linkages, and tertiary industry dominant in terms of net backward linkages, helping control CO2 according to its origin; (4) CO2 emissions induced by household strikingly affected total CO2 emissions in Beijing, mainly coming from income-oriented affects, with a large rural-urban disparity and a similar sectoral distribution pattern. Finally, we propose suggestions on carbon reduction in terms of technological interlinkages, final demand and household participation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ICFMP can also facilitate capacity expansion planning for energy production facilities within a multi-period and multi-option context. Then, a real case study of energy systems planning in Beijing is applied to illustrate the applicability of the ICFMP, with an objective of minimizing system cost and under constraints of resources availability and environmental regulations. Various energy policies are incorporated within the modeling formulation, which can enhance the ICFMP's capability for planning municipal energy systems. The ICFMP is transformed into two deterministic submodels that correspond to the lower aid upper bounds for the desired objective function value. The results indicate that reasonable solutions for both binary and continuous variables have been generated under different levels of constraint-violation risk.

By combining input-output analysis with ecological network analysis, the embodied energy and carbon footprint implied in urban products and services can be quantified. On this basis, we introduced energy structure indices based on the embodied energy per unit carbon emitted (i.e., the emission efficiency), which we used to evaluate the energy structure attributes of the metabolic actors. This approach provides a scientific basis for energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. Beijing is trying to control pollution (especially the smog produced by coal combustion), and this task is complicated by its large metabolic fluxes and strong metabolic influence. In this study, we analyzed the energy consumption structure of 28 sectors in Beijing from the perspective of their carbon footprint, and divided the sectors into four categories based on the relationship between their embodied energy consumption and the emission efficiency. We found that most sectors had high energy consumption and low emission efficiency, and that from 2000 to 2010, Beijing's overall consumption structure alternated between high and low embodied energy per unit of carbon emission, but the overall trend of emission efficiency changed toward higher. The insights provided by our analysis reveal ways to reduce carbon emission. Based on the carbon footprints of the 28 sectors, we propose how managers could adjust its energy consumption structure to decrease energy consumption and carbon emission. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Different forms of energy analysis can provide various insights for energy policy making. This paper brought together three approaches for energy consumption accounting, i.e., energy flow analysis (EFA), input-output analysis (IOA) and ecological network analysis (ENA), and compared their different perspectives and the policy implications for urban energy use. Beijing was used to exemplify the different energy analysis processes, and the 42 economic sectors of the city were aggregated into seven components. It was determined that EFA quantifies both the primary and final energy consumption of the urban components by tracking the different types of fuel used by the urban economy. IOA accounts for the embodied energy consumption (direct and indirect) used to produce goods and services in the city, whereas the control analysis of ENA quantifies the specific embodied energy that is regulated by the activities within the city's boundary. The network control analysis can also be applied to determining which economic sectors drive the energy consumption and to what extent these sectors are dependent on each other for energy. So-called ""controlled energy"" is a new concept that adds to the analysis of urban energy consumption, indicating the adjustable energy consumed by sectors.

The latter translate into reduced emissions of greenhouse gas (thus reduced radiative forcing) and other pollutants, such as ozone precursors (thus improved air quality). Because large-scale PV deployments can alter the radiative balance at the surface-atmosphere interface, they can exert certain impacts on the temperature and flow fields. In this analysis, meteorological modeling was performed for the Los Angeles region as a case study to evaluate the potential atmospheric effects of solar PV deployment. The simulations show no adverse impacts on air temperature and urban heat islands from largescale PV deployment. For the range of solar conversion efficiencies currently available or expected to become attainable in the near future, the deployment of solar PV can cool the urban environment. The cooling can reach up to 0.2 C in the Los Angeles region. Under hypothetical future-year scenarios of cool cities (urban areas with extensive implementations of highly-reflective roofs and pavements) and high-density deployments of urban solar PV arrays, some adverse impacts (0.1 C or less in warming) might occur. However, such extreme high-density deployments of cool surfaces are not expected and thus the warming effects are unlikely to result. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, ambient BC was measured in Rubidoux, California, approximately 90 km (55 miles) downwind of downtown Los Angeles. Collocated NOx and NOy measurements were used to estimate the photochemical age of the sampled air. Sampling was conducted throughout entire days between February 3, 2015 and March 12, 2015 to capture diurnal and daily variations in ambient BC. Both ambient and thermally-denuded air was sampled in 15-min cycles to compare the physical and optical, properties of coated versus uncoated BC particles. Physical properties of individual BC particles including mass and coating thickness were measured using a Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), and BC optical properties were measured using a Photoacoustic Extinctiometer (PAX) at 870 nm. The mean BC mass concentration (+/- standard deviation) for the campaign was 0.12 +/- 0.08 mu g m(-3). BC mass concentrations were higher on weekdays than weekends, though only differences between 11:00 and 17:00 h were statistically distinguishable. The fraction of total BC particles that were thickly-coated (f) was found to be relatively low, with a mean of 0.05 +/- 0.02 over the campaign. Values for f peaked in the afternoon when photochemical pollutant concentrations are also generally at a maximum. Further, fat 15:00-16:00 h was found to be statistically higher on weekends than weekdays, potentially due to a higher relative amount of ambient SOA to BC on weekends versus weekdays, which would enhance SOA coating of primary BC particles as they age during transport from the western Los Angeles basin to our sampling site on weekends. Differences at other hours during the photochemically active period of the day (10:00 14:00 h) were not statistically different although the weekend values were systematically higher. Comparing f with the photochemical age (PCA) of sampled air showed increases in f as PCA increases; the mean value (+/- 95% confidence interval) off for PCA < 1 h was 0.037 +/- 0.004, while that for PCA > 3 h was 0.12 +/- 0.04.

1483,WOS:000401881300033,"Municipal solid waste composting is seen as a promising technology in Sub-Saharan Africa to offset greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) program. The main reasons given therefore are the large organic fraction in municipal solid waste in this world region and the low complexity of the technology. The investigation results of case studies from other world regions suggest that the knowledge of local stakeholders involved in CDM composting projects is another crucial factor for their success and sustainability. The existing knowledge and knowledge demand of these stakeholders, however, is rarely considered in CDM composting project design documents from Sub-Saharan Africa. The study presented in the article at hand aimed to investigate both the existing knowledge and knowledge gaps of local stakeholders in a CDM waste composting project implemented in 17 cities in the Sub-Saharan African country of Uganda. This was done by selecting one of these cities (Busia) as a case study. After identifying the most important local stakeholders, methods of data collection and analysis (i.e. interviews, focus group discussions, compost field tests, material flow analysis, and full cost accounting) were embedded in an action research framework and applied to the case study of Busia prior to implementation of the CDM project. Furthermore, ways of closing the knowledge gaps identified were elaborated. Results showed that city authorities implementing and operating the CDM composting project, as well as farmers as potential users of the compost, were the two most relevant stakeholder groups. For city authorities, a knowledge gap regarding the net costs and benefits associated with the CDM project was identified, due to the underestimation of operation costs for composting and the overestimation of revenues from compost sales in the CDM project design document. The overestimation of compost sales revenues was due to the non-existence of a compost market, explained by the lack of experience and knowledge of farmers with respect to compost use and its value. While this knowledge among farmers can be acquired, for instance by means of agricultural extension services, key factors for marketing the compost, such as appropriate compost prices and compost quality, must also be addressed as part of a comprehensive solution.

This is especially the case in developing world cities where decision-makers struggle to keep up with the pace and scale of change. Focusing on Palembang in Indonesia, this paper considers the economic case for proactive investment in low-carbon development. We find that a rapidly growing industrial city in a developing country can reduce emissions by 24.1% in 2025, relative to business as usual levels, with investments of USD405.6 million that would reduce energy expenditure in the city by USD436.8 million. Emissions from the regional grid could be reduced by 12.2% in 2025, relative to business as usual trends, with investments of USD2.9 billion that would generate annual savings of USD175 million. These estimates understate the savings from reduced expenditure on energy subsidies and energy infrastructure. The compelling economic case for mainstreaming climate mitigation in this developing country city suggests that the constraints on climate action can be political and institutional rather than economic. There is therefore a need for more effective energy governance to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Policies to increase the share of renewable energies and energy efficiency measures are implemented at local scale. Municipalities, as responsible entities for physical planning, can hold a key role in transforming energy systems towards carbon-neutrality, based on renewable energies. The implementation should be approached at community scale, which has advantages compared to only focusing on buildings or cities. But community energy planning can be a complex and time-consuming process. Many municipalities hesitate to initiate such a process, because of missing guidelines and uncertainty about possible energy potentials. Case studies help to understand applied methodologies and could show available energy potentials in different local settings. The current case study presents a community energy concept for the inner-city of Elmshorn. By estimating the energy demand, consideration of local energy saving potentials, and available energy potentials within the community, it was possible to develop several energy system variants that virtually allow a heating energy and electricity supply fully based on local, renewable energy resources. The most feasible and cost-efficient variant is the use of local food production waste in a CHP plant feeding a district heating grid. The overall aim is to show that a self-sufficient heat- and electricity supply of typical urban communities is possible and can be implemented in a cost-efficient way, if the energy planning is done systematically and in coherence with urban planning.

1491,WOS:000398871400022,"The design of energy conservative buildings that incorporates natural ventilation (NV) strategy has become increasingly popular around the world. Natural ventilation is a key solution for reducing energy consumption of buildings and for maintaining a healthy indoor environment. However, the adoption of natural ventilation in high-rise buildings is less common. As rapid population growth and urbanization take place in cities, it is important to explore the substantial energy saving potential of high rises by utilizing natural ventilation. In this study, we have provided the early effort to estimate quantitatively the vertical profiles of NV potential for high rises at major cities from six climate zones in the U.S. (i.e., Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, and Minneapolis), using an in-house boundary layer meteorology model. The diurnal cycle of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and local climate characteristics are found to have a great effect on the vertical structure of NV potential. In general, negative vertical gradients of NV hours are observed for all cities except Miami where the vertical distribution is nearly uniform. For example, the annual NV hour decreases from 7258 at ground level to 4866 at 300 m above the ground in Los Angeles. Our analysis shows that outdoor temperature is a key meteorological parameter that determines vertical profiles of NV hours in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Minneapolis. In contrast, humidity plays a greater role in cities like Miami and Houston where the outdoor temperature is often favorable for using natural ventilation except in the summer. Among studied cities, Los Angeles provides the ideal climate (warm and dry) for utilizing natural ventilation, displaying the greatest NV potential (7258 NV hours or 83% time of the year at ground level), followed by New York City with 3360 NV hours. The remainder of the four studied cities display comparable numbers of NV hours of approximately 2500 at ground level.

We provide a background on rural co-operatives and municipal utilities in the context of the US electric sector and highlight the challenges and opportunities of implementing DSM programs in these institutions. Where past studies of utility DSM have mostly focused on IOUs or consisted of qualitative case studies of municipal utilities with exemplary DSM performance, this study makes a unique contribution to the DSM literature by systematically analyzing an entire co-operative and municipal utility population in Minnesota through the use of a survey. In doing so, we provide policy recommendations relevant to energy planners and policy makers to Support DSM in rural electric co-operatives and municipal utilities. (C) 2008 Professor E. Wilson.

1494,WOS:000336017400021,"Existing strategies for residential energy savings through physical renovation or motivating occupant energy conservation behavior can be costly and/or have transitory effects. Focusing on multi-family dwellings, an important subset of the urban residential sector, we propose an Energy Saving Alignment Strategy (ESAS) that has advantageous cost-effectiveness and a long-lasting influence. By aligning the distribution of residents' thermostat preferences with the indoor temperature, ESAS aims to maximize thermal comfort and, accordingly, energy savings in multi-family buildings where indoor temperatures vary between apartments as a function of apartment orientation and floor level. Using a case study of a 1084-apartment public housing complex in New York, we classify both occupants' thermostat preferences and apartments' operative temperatures into five groups, and optimize energy efficiency by assigning each group of occupants to the group of apartments that best aligns with their thermostat preference. We test ESAS in eight cities representing all four U.S. census regions and six climate zones. Simulation results reveal 2.1-42.0% in energy savings compared to random apartment assignments depending on geographic location, with the highest energy reductions occurring in cities with mild climates, where the range of occupant thermostat preferences coincides with the natural indoor temperature range. We conclude by providing suggested guidelines on how ESAS might work in practice, and recommendations for extending ESAS research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Union (EU) project Urban Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in China and Europe (URGENCHE) explored a methodological approach to assess traffic noise-related well-being impacts of transport interventions in three European cities (Basel, Rotterdam and Thessaloniki) linking modeled traffic noise reduction effects with survey data indicating noise-well-being associations. Local noise models showed a reduction of high traffic noise levels in all cities as a result of different urban interventions. Survey data indicated that perception of high noise levels was associated with lower probability of well-being. Connecting the local noise exposure profiles with the noise-well-being associations suggests that the urban transport interventions may have a marginal but positive effect on population well-being. This paper also provides insight into the methodological challenges of well-being assessments and highlights the range of limitations arising from the current lack of reliable evidence on environmental conditions and well-being.

1497,WOS:000419779300008,"With the rise of Asia in the global economy, it is important for developing countries in Asia to break away from energy and resource intensive growth models and explore low carbon pathways. In this process, urban energy policies are crucial and pioneering cities should play a leading role. The change in energy consumption patterns in three cities, i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, and Bangkok, was studied, and these cities' low carbon development strategies were reviewed. It was found that total energy consumption in the three cities has shown a tendency towards being stable or even started to decrease. The energy consumption by industry has started to decrease or stopped increasing. Service sectors became the most important energy consumers in all three cities, particularly the transport sector in Bangkok. Household energy consumption gradually increased in Beijing and Shanghai. Electricity use at home and energy for vehicles are becoming more important with urbanization and changes in lifestyles. All three cities have adopted a variety of low carbon development strategies, such as transition towards a lower carbon economy, developing a low carbon transportation system, and adopting cleaner and renewable substitutes for electricity to disengage from the dependency on coal and petroleum products. However, most low carbon strategies have focused on industrial and service sectors. Those cities should also explore and lead more sustainable lifestyles, which are important for system-wide energy savings.

1498,WOS:000324743500006,"Landfilling is the most common and cost-effective waste disposal method, and it is widely applied throughout the world. In developing countries in Asia there is currently a trend towards constructing sanitary landfills with gas recovery systems, not only as a solution to the waste problem and the associated local environmental pollution, but also to generate revenues through carbon markets and from the sale of electricity. This article presents a quantitative assessment of climate co-benefits from landfill gas (LFG) to energy projects, based on the case of Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Thailand. Life cycle assessment was used for estimating net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, considering the whole lifespan of the landfill. The assessment found that the total GHG mitigation of the Bangkok project would be 471,763 tonnes (t) of carbon dioxide (CO2)-equivalents (eq) over its 10-year LFG recovery period. This amount is equivalent to only 12% of the methane (CH4) generated over the whole lifespan of the landfill. An alternative scenario was devised to analyse possible improvement options for GHG mitigation through LFG-to-energy recovery projects. This scenario assumes that LFG recovery would commence in the second year of landfill operation and gas extraction continues throughout the 20-year peak production period. In this scenario, GHG mitigation potential amounted to 1,639,450 tCO(2)-eq during the 20-year project period, which is equivalent to 43% of the CH4 generated throughout the life cycle. The results indicate that with careful planning, there is a high potential for improving the efficiency of existing LFG recovery projects which would enhance climate co-benefits, as well as economic benefits. However, the study also shows that even improved gas recovery systems have fairly low recovery rates and, in consequence, that emissions of GHG from such landfills sites are still considerable.","Menikpura, SNM, Sang-Arun, J, Bengtsson, M",6,Bangkok,THA,10.1177/0734242X13492004,SRID=4326;POINT (100.50144 13.75398),5104476,Climate co-benefits of energy recovery from landfill gas in developing Asian cities: a case study in Bangkok,2013
1499,WOS:000388014600016,"In light of the growing emphasis of the desalination industry on high recovery low energy processes to save water and energy with reduced needs for handling of brine effluents, the present study evaluates the prospects of reaching such objectives with plug flow desalination (PFD) techniques of internal/external partial concentrate recycling (PCR) and closed circuit desalination (CCD) of complete concentrate recycling. Comparison between the cited RO techniques is demonstrated by means of a versatile theoretical model database which addresses the unit configuration, module design, elements' specifications, module recovery, degree of PCR, flow rates, and other pertinent parameters which contribute to trustworthy model results. A comprehensive comparative model analysis of CCD and PFD-PCR with identical four-element modules under the same module recovery, concentration polarization, and initial flow rate conditions revealed that CCD is by far the best process to achieve high recovery with exceptionally low energy not possible by any conventional PFD method including such with either internal or external PCR. While PFD with internal PCR gave permeates of somewhat better quality compared with CCD, increased recovery with PCR by this technique is limited and proceeds with a much greater energy demand. While PFD with external PCR allows increased recovery comparable to that of CCD, this is achieved at the expense of inferior quality permeates and exceptionally high energy consumption. Trends revealed in the present study for four-element modules are of general implications for CCD and for single-stage or multi-stage PFD, with/without PCR, systems of different module designs and operational conditions. The high recovery low energy prospects created by CCD, unmatched by conventional PFD techniques, have been confirmed experimentally by the reported 96% (0.34 kWh/m(3)) desalination of domestic water supplies (553 mu S/cm) in Kansas City, USA.",,0,Kansas City,USA,10.1080/19443994.2016.1206091,SRID=4326;POINT (-94.57857 39.09973),475378,CCD Series no-24: closed circuit desalination compared with plug flow desalination processes of partial concentrate recycling in identical four-element modules,2016

1501,WOS:000366999400011,"We combine Landsat and MODIS data in a land model to assess the impact of urbanization on US surface climate. For cities built within forests, daytime urban land surface temperature (LST) is much higher than that of vegetated lands. For example, in Washington DC and Atlanta, daytime mean temperature differences between impervious and vegetated lands reach 3.3 and 2.0 degrees C, respectively. Conversely, for cities built within arid lands, such as Phoenix, urban areas are 2.2 degrees C cooler than surrounding shrubs. We find that the choice and amount of tree species in urban settings play a commanding role in modulating cities' LST. At continental and monthly scales, impervious surfaces are 1.9 degrees C +/- 0.6 degrees C warmer than surroundings during summer and expel 12% of incoming precipitation as surface runoff compared to 3.2% over vegetation. We also show that the carbon lost to urbanization represents 1.8% of the continental total, a striking number considering urbanization occupies only 1.1% of the US land. With a small areal extent, urbanization has significant effects on surface energy, water and carbon budgets and reveals an uneven impact on surface climate that should inform upon policy options for improving urban growth including heat mitigation and carbon sequestration.","Bounoua, L, Zhang, P, Mostovoy, G, Thome, K, Masek, J, Imhoff, M, Shepherd, M, Quattrochi, D, Santanello, J, Silva, J, Wolfe, R, Toure, AM",21,Atlanta; Phoenix,USA; USA,10.1088/1748-9326/10/8/084010,SRID=4326;POINT (-84.38798 33.749); SRID=4326;POINT (-112.07404 33.44838),463878; 1563025,Impact of urbanization on US surface climate,2015
1502,WOS:000384626400035,"Energy and resource consumption has been expanding quickly with the rapid growth of Asian cities, which has resulted in increased greenhouse gas emission and waste generation. The promotion of low carbon industries is an urgent global issue that extends to Asia as well. To reduce carbon dioxide emission substantially, industries must not only introduce energy-saving technologies but also use low carbon raw materials and fuel, such as recyclable wastes and carbon-neutral biomass. This paper presents the concept of a ""hybrid industry,"" that is, an industry whose processes utilize not only fossil resources but also recycled and renewable resources as much as possible. This study examines the feasibility of hybrid industries through the promotion of urban symbiosis in cities in three Asian countries with different circumstances: Kawasaki in Japan, Ulsan in Korea, and Shenyang in China. Asian cities are in the midst of shifting from dumping wastes to incineration. However, in view of the carbon reduction effect of recycling as well as the cost for recycling and appropriate treatment of wastes, the potential of hybrid industries that use combustible municipal wastes as input should be considered. In this study, the potential for carbon dioxide reduction as well as the costs of promoting hybrid industries are evaluated. The results highlight that promoting hybrid industries generates significant environmental benefits for the three cities, and there are important factors that affect the cost-effectiveness of hybrid industries, including the spatial density of waste generation, composition of wastes, relative labor cost for collection and pre-treatment of wastes compared with construction cost of an incinerator and avoided costs through product and fossil resource substitution, and the willingness of citizens to separate wastes. Finally, key drivers for promoting hybrid industries through urban symbiosis in Asian cities are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Naturally ventilated buildings can have low energy demands but the strategy is difficult to implement in deep plan, urban locations. The Frederick Lanchester Library at Coventry University, UK, incorporates natural ventilation, daylighting and passive cooling strategies. By using lightwells and perimeter stacks to supply and exhaust air, it can be ventilated by natural means despite its deep plan form and sealed facade. This paper describes the building and presents the energy consumption and the internal temperatures and CO, levels recorded in 2004/2005. The building's performance is compared to the original design criteria and good practice guidelines. Recommendations for the design of such buildings are made and the likely performance in other UK cities is assessed. It is concluded that the building uses under half the energy of a standard air-conditioned building and yet, in summer, can keep the interior comfortable and up to 5 degrees C below ambient. The design would perform equally well in the typical weather conditions experienced at 13 other UK cities, but not in London.

The present study identified the important stressors affecting Greenwich Bay benthic fauna. First, existing data and information were used to confirm that the waterbody was impaired. Second, the presence of source, stressor, and effect were established. Then linkages between source, stressor, and effect were developed. This allows identification of probable stressors adversely affecting the waterbody. Three pollutant categories were assessed: chemicals, nutrients, and suspended sediments. This weight of evidence approach indicated that Greenwich Bay was primarily impacted by eutrophication-related stressors. The sediments of Greenwich Bay were carbon enriched and low dissolved oxygen concentrations were commonly seen, especially in the western portions of Greenwich Bay. The benthic community was depauperate, as would be expected under oxygen stress. Although our analysis indicated that contaminant loads in Greenwich Bay were at concentrations where adverse effects might be expected, no toxicity was observed, as a result of high levels of organic carbon in these sediments reducing contaminant bioavailability. Our analysis also indicated that suspended sediment impacts were likely nonexistent for much of the Bay.

Results show that the total GHG emissions of industrial process has increased, from 1.48 Mt in 2004 to 4.06 Mt in 2009, except for a little decrease in 2008. The cement industry, and iron and steel industries, are the main emission sources, accounting for more than 90% of the total carbon emissions. GHG emissions in 2020 are estimated based on scenario analysis. The research indicates that the cement industry, and iron and steel industries, will still be the largest emission sources, and the total carbon emissions under the business as usual (BAU) scenario will be doubled in 2020 compared with that of 2009. However, when countermeasures are taken, the GHG emission will reduce significantly. Using more clinker substitutes for blended cement, and increasing direct reduction iron process and recycled steel scraps are efficient measures in reducing GHG emission. Scenario 4, which has the highest ratio of 30/70 blended cement and the highest ratio of steel with recycled steel-EAF process, is the best one. In this scenario, the industrial process GHG emission in 2020 can almost stay the same as that of 2009. From the perspective of regions, cement industry and iron and steel industry accounted for the vast majority of GHG emission in all industries.

In the context of local energy planning, however, the increasingly active attitude of local stakeholders has not yet been corresponded by an evolution on the way how targets are set. The aim of this work is to review how targets are currently defined and, after justification is found, to develop a new methodology for target setting in the context of local energy planning, that can guide local authorities and other stakeholders to act towards global climate change mitigation and other policy objectives.

We find that the coherence of national and city level policies is the highest in regulated areas, such as waste management and building regulation. Voluntary action is easily taken at local level in areas where co-benefits can be expected: e.g. energy conservation and biofuels for transportation. These voluntary actions can show the feasibility of certain measures which can later on be implemented at national or supranational. level. We observe a clear contradiction between the EU and national renewable electricity targets and the nonaction at the city level: local conditions and private interests pose barriers to the implementation of a climate policy. We conclude that the coherence between policies at different levels develops over time and international requirements as well as local conditions can be drivers for it. Cities in particular play a role in mitigating climate change through removing barriers for the implementation of national and EU policies, and through moving forward with and promoting innovative voluntary measures, e.g. through international city networks.

The market for the distributed power generation based on renewable energy is increasing, particularly for the standalone mini-grid applications. The main design components of PV/Wind hybrid system are the PV panels and the wind turbine. The case study is realized using the meteorological data for a Typical Metrological Year (TMY) for the city of Belgrade, in Serbia. The dynamical analysis is based on the transient system simulation program TRNSYS 16. The purpose of the study is to design a realistic energy system that maximizes the use of renewable energy and minimizes the use of fossil fuels. The reduction in the CO2 emissions is also analyzed in the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study estimates the amount of BVOCs carbon emitted in relation to carbon fixation for the built-up areas and rural forests in a subtropical urban-rural complex. Urban greenspace was subdivided into block greenspace and linear greenspace, while rural areas were characterized by four forest types. A field survey was conducted to assess the vegetation composition, biomass and foliar mass for each tree species. Results showed (1) the emissions intensity of BVOC in the greater Ningbo area is 4.48 x 10(6) g C km(-2) yr(-1), the average emission intensity of the greenspace in the built-up areas (2.86 x 10(6) g C km(-2) yr(-1)) is higher than rural forests excluding bamboo forest (2.66 x 10(6) g C km(-2) yr(-1)); (2) the contribution of carbon emitted as BVOCs to net primary production (NPP) (BVOCs/NPP ratio) is about 4.3%, with 1.8% for the built-up areas which is lower than that for rural forests including bamboo forest (4.4%), but higher than rural forests excluding bamboo forest (0.96%); (3) the BVOCs/NPP ratio between native and exotic tree species exhibits no significant difference. The results suggest that BVOC emissions can be reduced while carbon sequestration can be increased by planting trees with low-emitting but high carbon fixation capacity in built-up areas, and by reducing bamboo forest while restoring broad-leaved forest in rural forests.

1512,WOS:000292348000016,"Coastal areas constitute important habitats, and they contain a large and growing population, much of it located in economic centers such as London, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, Mumbai, and Lagos. The range of coastal hazards includes climate-induced sea level rise, a long-term threat that demands broad response. Global sea levels rose 17 cm through the twentieth century, and are likely to rise more rapidly through the twenty-first century when a rise of more than 1 m is possible. In some locations, these changes may be exacerbated by (1) increases in storminess due to climate change, although this scenario is less certain, and (2) widespread human-induced subsidence due to ground fluid withdrawal from, and drainage of, susceptible soils, especially in deltas. Relative sea level rise has a range of potential impacts, including higher extreme sea levels (and flooding), coastal erosion, salinization of surface and ground waters, and degradation of coastal habitats such as wetlands. Without adaptation, large land areas and millions of people could be displaced by sea level rise. Appropriate responses include climate mitigation (a global response) and/or adaptation (a local response). A combination of these strategies appears to be the most appropriate approach to sea level rise regardless of the uncertainty. Adaptation responses can be characterized as (1) protect, (2) accommodate, or (3) retreat. While these adaptation responses could reduce impacts significantly, they will need to be consistent with responses to all coastal hazards, as well as with wider societal and development objectives; hence, an integrated coastal management philosophy is required. In some developed countries, including England and the Netherlands, proactive adaptation plans are already being formulated. Coastal cities worldwide will be a major focus for adaptation efforts because of their concentrations of people Sand assets. Developing countries will pose adaptation challenges, especially in deltaic areas and small islands, which are the most vulnerable settings.","Nicholls, RJ",86,Tokyo; Lagos; New York City; London; Mumbai; Shanghai,JPN; NGA; USA; GBR; IND; CHN,10.5670/oceanog.2011.34,SRID=4326;POINT (139.69171 35.6895); SRID=4326;POINT (3.39467 6.45407); SRID=4326;POINT (-74.00597 40.71427); SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853); SRID=4326;POINT (72.88261 19.07283); SRID=4326;POINT (121.45806 31.22222),8336599; 9000000; 8175133; 7556900; 12691836; 22315474,Planning for the Impacts of Sea Level Rise,2011
1513,WOS:000335423900051,"China is now in the process of rapid urbanization. City's operating efficiency was directly determined by the scale and efficiency of energy consumption and flow. The pattern, scale and efficiency of urban carbon flow are not only important indicators that reflect urban efficiency and sustainable development, but also important references in the formulating low-carbon and sustainable energy polices for cities. Through establishing a theoretical framework and calculation method, this paper studied the carbon flows of Nanjing urban system in three different levels. It shows that urban production and transportation system, urban living system, rural production system and rural living systems are the major part of urban system in the carbon flow. The carbon flows between Nanjing and the external system, was much higher than the carbon flows among different internal subsystems. If the embodied carbon is taken into account, carbon flow from the urban to rural system of Nanjing was clearly greater than the flow in the opposite direction. With economic development and the implement of energy-saving and emission reduction policy, the carbon productivity and carbon flow efficiency in Nanjing has improved significantly since 2000. Fossil energy consumption, urbanization, agricultural activities, rural life demands and trade are key factors with major impact on urban carbon flows in Nanjing. Therefore, adjusting industrial structure, urban expansion control, and developing renewable energy are main measures to realize sustainable development of Najing city. Furthermore, the dual urban-rural structure in Nanjing brought large exchanges of products and embodied carbon between urban and rural areas, indicates that urban carbon flow and its efficiency was highly influenced by urban-rural structure, which will further aggravate carbon flow burden of urban systems.

1514,WOS:000352246000006,"Restoration of composition, structure, and function in oak dominated ecosystems is the focus of management in temperate forests around the world. Land managers focused on oak ecosystem restoration are challenged by the legacy effects of complex land-use histories, urbanization, climate change, and potential stakeholder response to management. Trade-offs may exist between managing forests for climate mitigation (e.g., maximizing C storage or sequestration) and promoting shade-intolerant species historically associated with frequent or high-severity disturbances. This study assessed the potentially conflicting goals of sustained live biomass accrual and increased oak regeneration in the East Woods Natural Area at The Morton Arboretum in Lisle, IL, USA. We evaluated how biomass trends and oak regeneration were related to management regimes, land-use history, current stand structure and composition, and topoedaphic factors. Our results indicated no significant trade-off between sustained live biomass accrual and oak regeneration. Live biomass was increasing across the landscape (biomass increment averaged 18,186 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and was not strongly related to differences in management or land-use history. Oak regeneration was rare, especially beyond the seedling stage (similar to 226 seedlings and 9 saplings ha(-1)) and was also not strongly related to recent management. Our results indicate that even 20+ years of annual prescribed burning combined with understory thinning has failed to produce the open canopy conditions and high light availability that are necessary for successful oak recruitment. The absence of any trade-offs between biomass accrual and oak regeneration may, therefore, be largely related to the ineffectiveness of current management for promoting oak regeneration. More intensive management utilizing canopy manipulations could produce greater trade-offs, but is likely necessary to establish and release oak regeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1515,WOS:000402343500018,"Accurately understanding the real situation of China's carbon emissions at the provincial level is not only crucial for realizing carbon mitigation in China, but also of great importance for tackling climate change on a global scale. This paper uses detailed energy consumption data subdivided within each fuel type and sector-specific emission factors, to calculate both direct and indirect energy-related CO2 emissions for China's provinces, and offers provincially-targeted policy proposals on emission reductions. The results uncover large divergences in calculation of provincial CO2 emissions between production-based and consumption-based accounting approaches. Considering the large amount of interprovincial CO2 emission transfers embodied in secondary energy deployment, the consumption-based accounting performs better in reflecting the actual features and responsibilities of carbon emissions in the provinces of China. From the consumption perspective, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Henan, Liaoning and Shanxi contributed to the majority of China's carbon emission growth during the period of 1996-2013, while Xinjiang, Sichuan, Anhui, Tianjin and Hunan were playing an increasingly important role. These two groups of provinces should be regarded as the key regions for national emissions abatement. Meanwhile, the energy industry was the top sectoral contributor to CO2 emissions growth in most provinces, while service and household sectors made increasingly significant impacts on driving up provincial emissions. Together with ongoing efforts in the energy sector, the mitigation of CO2 emissions in service and household sectors deserves much more attention, especially in the transportation and urban household sectors. Furthermore, the temporal trends of carbon emissions in various provinces, as well as their factor and sectoral driving forces, varied greatly with each other. Therefore, each of the provinces should formulate emission reduction policies according to their own situation, and target the key driving factors and sectors of carbon emissions at the current stage or in the near future.

1516,WOS:000317150000007,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how cities at different stages of development each subject to its own challenges in adapting to climate change can manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Design/methodology/approach - Case studies are undertaken for three cities: Amman, Jakarta and Dar es Salaam, including determination of GHG emissions and analysis of climate change data (where available) for each. Findings - In Amman, the most climate-sensitive municipal service is water; Jordan is exceptionally dry, and nearly 15 per cent of all electricity consumption is by the water authority. Jakarta has already experienced extreme flooding. The climate vulnerabilities associated with sea-level rise are intensified by subsidence in parts of Jakarta. Alternating floods and droughts are climate impacts already experienced in Dar es Salaam. Droughts have impacted Tanzania's electricity infrastructure disrupting hydroelectricity production, requiring new natural gas infrastructure to maintain power, thereby increasing GHG emissions. Nonetheless, Dar es Salaam's GHG emissions at 0.56 t CO(2)e/cap are small compared to Amman and Jakarta at 3.66 and 4.92 t CO(2)e/cap., respectively. Originality/value - Synergist development strategies, addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation are suggested. In Amman an increased share of photovoltaic electricity production might be used for service provision, especially for energy needs surrounding water supply. Advanced slum upgrading in Jakarta could see relocation of the at-risk poor to safe areas with energy efficient homes connected to public transit and decentralized, community-based electricity generation. The focus in Dar es Salaam community-based waste-to-energy facilities would reduce climate change impacts and vulnerabilities while addressing energy poverty in poor communities.","Sugar, L, Kennedy, C, Hoornweg, D",11,Amman; Jakarta,JOR; IDN,10.1108/17568691311299381,SRID=4326;POINT (35.94503 31.95522); SRID=4326;POINT (106.84513 -6.21462),1275857; 8540121,"Synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation in development Case studies of Amman, Jakarta, and Dar es Salaam",2013

In this study, models combining card, survey, and geographic information systems (GIS) data are established with a research focus on the private driving restriction policies being implemented in an ever-increasing number of cities. The study aims to evaluate the impact of these policies on the travel mode shift, as well as relevant carbon emission reductions. The private driving restriction policy implemented in Beijing is taken as an example. The impact of the restriction policy on the travel mode shift from cars to subways is analyzed through a model based on metro AFC data. The routing paths of these passengers are also analyzed based on the GIS method and on survey data, while associated carbon emission reductions are estimated. The analysis method used in this study can provide reference for the application of big data in evaluating transport policies. Implications: Motor vehicles have become the most prevalent source of emissions and subsequently air pollution within Chinese cities. The evaluation of the effects of driving restriction policies on the travel mode shift and vehicle emissions will be useful for other cities in the future.

This model was based on the integration of multiple inexact optimization techniques, including interval-parameter programming, mixed-integer programming and chance-constrained programming, which make it have strength in dealing with uncertainties presented as both probabilistic distributions and interval numbers. The model could effectively facilitate systematic analysis of complexities associated with energy conversion and utilization, and air pollution mitigation. Particularly, it could help identify optimal patterns of energy resources allocation, as well as capacity expansion options for energy technologies under different air pollution emission reduction schemes. This could not only alleviate air pollution in the city, but also reduce the total system cost that was associated with various energy activities. Based on a two-step solution algorithm, useful solutions were generated, reflecting tradeoffs among environmental and economic conditions, and among different risk violation levels of constraints of the energy system in Beijing city.

1525,WOS:000382409700034,"The deployment of electric vehicles has attracted growing attention and is now seen as a possible pathway for a transition towards sustainable transportation. This paper provides insight into the commercialization of electric vehicles in Shenzhen focusing on business innovation and the regulatory context in which it occurs. Using the business model canvas framework, this paper analyzes interactions between enterprises and governments along the value chain of electric vehicles in the bus and taxi fleets. It also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Shenzhen model both in business innovation and government regulation for promoting electric vehicle use. This paper finds that Shenzhen has succeeded in fostering a distinct government-enterprise cooperation model that not only reduces the financial pressure on the local government to promote electric vehicle use, but also gives enterprises significant leeway to experiment with various innovative business models. The joint result of these efforts is that the commercialization of electric vehicles has become feasible for delivering the public transport service (buses and taxis) in Shenzhen. Still, this paper argues that the current model of Shenzhen can be further enhanced by: 1) encouraging private investment in charging infrastructures by means of public-private-partnerships; and 2) standardizing electric-vehicle technologies and production to break down the local protectionism in the electric vehicle market. The Shenzhen model acts as a source of inspiration by pointing out the significance of integrating business innovations and government regulations to facilitate the deployment of electric vehicles, which provides practical lessons for industrial players and policy makers in other cities.

1528,WOS:000413804700001,"Extreme heat has tremendous adverse effects on human health. Heat stress is expected to further increase due to urbanization, an aging population, and global warming. Previous research has identified correlations between extreme heat and mortality. However, the underlying physical, behavioral, environmental, and social risk factors remain largely unknown and comprehensive quantitative investigation on an individual level is lacking. We conducted a new cross-sectional household questionnaire survey to analyze individual heat impairment (self-assessed and reported symptoms) and a large set of potential risk factors in the city of Berlin, Germany. This unique dataset (n = 474) allows for the investigation of new relationships, especially between health/fitness and urban heat stress. Our analysis found previously undocumented associations, leading us to generate new hypotheses for future research: various health/fitness variables returned the strongest associations with individual heat stress. Our primary hypothesis is that age, the most commonly used risk factor, is outperformed by health/fitness as a dominant risk factor. Related variables seem to more accurately represent humans' cardiovascular capacity to handle elevated temperature. Among them, active travel was associated with reduced heat stress. We observed statistical associations for heat exposure regarding the individual living space but not for the neighborhood environment. Heat stress research should further investigate individual risk factors of heat stress using quantitative methodologies. It should focus more on health and fitness and systematically explore their role in adaptation strategies. The potential of health and fitness to reduce urban heat stress risk means that encouraging active travel could be an effective adaptation strategy. Through reduced CO2 emissions from urban transport, societies could reap double rewards by addressing two root causes of urban heat stress: population health and global warming.",,1,Berlin,DEU,10.1088/1748-9326/aa5f35,SRID=4326;POINT (13.41053 52.52437),3426354,Urban heat stress: novel survey suggests health and fitness as future avenue for research and adaptation strategies,2017

Since the urbanization rate in developing countries - like the case in Egypt - is rising rapidly, the pressure placed on energy resources to satisfy inhabitants' indoor comfort requirements is consequently increasing too. This paper introduces passive cool roof as a means of reducing energy cooling loads for satisfying human comfort requirements in a hot climate. A designed algorithmic hybrid matrix was used to simulate 37 roof design probabilities alternating roof shape, roof material and construction. The result of using a vault roof with high albedo coating shows a fall of 53% in discomfort hours and saves 826 kWh during the summer season compared to the base case of the conventional non insulated flat roof in a typical Cairo residential buildings. It is recommended that the selected cool roof solution be combined with natural ventilation to increase the indoor thermal comfort, and with passive heating strategies to compensate the increase in heating hours. The application is intended for low cost residential buildings in a hot dry climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This symposium addresses related knowledge gaps by exploring case studies of urban regions in the global South confronting their projected climate change challenges, showcasing the experiences of Delhi, Santiago de Chile and Bogota. Its specific aim is to explore the urban social response to nature change, the adaptation challenges faced by cities across the world and current practices of urban adaptation. Further, the symposium seeks to understand to what extent and in what respect current conceptual frameworks which highlight urban ecological security and vulnerability provide a useful context/framing to assist cities in confronting their challenges and to explain their actions. This introductory article examines current knowledge of the theory and practice of urban climate response.

1532,WOS:000180523300004,"It is commonly assumed that solar hot water systems save energy and reduce greenhouse emissions relative to conventional fossil fuel-powered systems. Very rarely has the life-cycle greenhouse emissions (including the embodied greenhouse emissions of manufacture) of solar hot water systems been analysed. The extent to which solar hot water systems can reduce emissions compared with conventional systems can be shown through a comparative life-cycle greenhouse emissions analysis. This method determined the time it takes for these net greenhouse emissions savings to occur, or the 'emissions payback period'. This paper presents the results of a life-cycle greenhouse emissions analysis of solar hot water systems in comparison with conventional hot water systems for a southern (Melbourne) and a northern (Brisbane) Australian city. The life-cycle costs of these hot water systems were also analysed to determine the financial payback period. The fuel source and solar fraction determined the emissions resulting from the energy used for operating hot water systems. The solar systems provide net emissions savings compared with the conventional systems after 2.5-5 years in Melbourne and after 2.5 years in Brisbane, depending on the auxiliary fuel. The life-cycle cost analysis also revealed that the financial payback period for solar hot water systems is more than 10 years in Melbourne and around 10 years for an electric-boosted system in Brisbane. This suggests the need for greater subsidies to increase market take-up for solar systems, especially where electricity is the only available fuel.",,17,Melbourne; Brisbane,AUS; AUS,10.1080/09613210210160800,SRID=4326;POINT (144.96332 -37.814); SRID=4326;POINT (153.02809 -27.46794),4246375; 2189878,Comparative greenhouse emissions analysis of domestic solar hot water systems,2003
1533,WOS:000387953500001,"Background: Dense settlement structures in cities have high demands of energy. Usually, these demands exceed the local resource availability. Individually developed supply options to cover these demands differ from place to place and can also vary within the boundaries of a city. In a common sense of European governance, cities are pushed to save energy, increase renewables and reduce import dependency on fossil fuels. There are many innovative concepts and technologies available to tackle these needs. The paper provides a comprehensive methodology for planning and assessing the development of 'smart' energy systems leading to complex energy provision technology networks using different on-site as well as off-site resources. Methods: The use of the P-graph (process-graph) method allows the optimisation of energy systems by using different energy sources for heating, storing and cooling. This paper discusses this method in the development of an urban brown field, the premises of the Reininghaus District, a former brewery in the city of Graz in Austria. The case study is interesting as it combines on-site energy sources (e.g. solar heat and photovoltaic) with nearby industrial waste heat and cooling at different temperatures and grid-based resources such as existing district heating, natural gas, and electricity. The case study also includes the competition between centralised technologies (e.g. large scale combined heat and power and heat pumps with district heating grids) and decentralised technologies (e.g. small scale combined heat and power, single building gas boilers, solar collectors, etc. in buildings). Ecological assessment with the Energetic Long-Term Analysis of Settlement Structures (ELAS) calculator provides an evaluation of the ecological impact of the developed energy systems. Results: Different scenarios based on two building standards OIB (low energy house standard) and NZE (passive house standard) as well as different prices for key energy resources were developed for an urban development concept for the Reininghaus District. The results of these scenarios show a very wide spectrum of structures of the energy system with strong variations often caused by small changes in cost or prices. The optimisation shows that small changes in the setup of the price/cost structure can cause dramatic differences in the optimal energy system to supply a smart city district. However, decentralised systems with low-temperature waste heat and decentralised heat pumps in the building groups show the financially most feasible and, compared to alternatives, most ecological way to supply the new buildings. Conclusions: The planning process for the development of the Reininghaus District is a complex and therefore lengthy process and shall be concretised over the next decades. Optimal energy technology networks and scenarios resulting from the application of the described methods support the framework energy plan. The accumulated knowledge can be used to form smart energy supply solutions as an integral part for the discussion of the stakeholders (investors, city department) to guide the forming of their action plan through the development of the city quarter.",,2,Graz,AUT,10.1186/s13705-016-0085-9,SRID=4326;POINT (15.45 47.06667),222326,Smart energy systems for smart city districts: case study Reininghaus District,2016
1534,WOS:000311461600004,"This paper engages key social theories of transnational mobilities in order to forge the concept of urban 'green' cosmopolitization, posited as a social scientific contribution to epochal conversations on climate change. Bringing Ulrich Beck's notion of 'cosmopolitization' to bear on recent work around 'urban policy mobilities', I analyze professional planning practices in large-scale world cities as privileged sites for contemporary imaginings and material implementations of low-carbon sociotechnical change. Focusing on the regions of Europe and Asia, I show how specific policies and technologies of urban greening circulate in intercity sustainability networks. These networks, I suggest, serve to organize processes of professional engagement with climate change around notions of innovation, learning, and 'best practice' policy transfer among urban professionals-thereby also excluding more 'radically' alternative futures. The paper then turns to explore how such green cosmopolitization works as a social force within specific urban localities, employing two ethnographic case studies into 'ambitious' low-carbon planning projects in Copenhagen and Kyoto, respectively. In particular, my analysis explores how place-based notions of 'culture' are mobilized in the urban visions of architects and engineers as resources for addressing global environmental risks. These spaces of urban green cosmopolitization, I conclude, emerge at the intersection of professional and vernacular ethico-political attachments, thereby reworking-in often contentious ways-how particular urban materials and spaces can be understood in reference to an emerging moral geography of shared climatic risks.","Blok, A",19,Kyoto; Copenhagen,JPN; DNK,10.1068/a44559,SRID=4326;POINT (135.75385 35.02107); SRID=4326;POINT (12.56553 55.67594),1459640; 1153615,Greening cosmopolitan urbanism?

The main purpose of the paper is to compare the proposed system with a conventional system composed of a natural gas-fired boiler (for thermal energy production) and a power plant mix connected to the Italian central grid (for electric energy production) in order to assess the potential energy saving under various operating scenarios. The simulations were performed by considering the multi-family house located into four different Italian cities (Palermo, Napoli, Roma and Milano) representative of different climatic regions of Italy in order to estimate the influence of climatic conditions; a parametric analysis was also performed with the aim to evaluate the sensitivity of the energy flows when varying the volume of the combined storage tank; taking into consideration that the economic viability of the cogeneration unit strongly depends also on the value of the co-produced electricity, the system performance was also evaluated by considering two different electric demand profiles (with and without the electric consumption associated to the overnight charging of an electric vehicle); the operation of the micro-cogeneration device was estimated under both electric and thermal load-following control strategies. The analyses showed that, in comparison to the conventional system, the proposed system allows for a relevant reduction of primary energy consumption under thermal load-following logic; significant effects of climatic conditions, tank volume, as well as electric demand profile on the simulation results were highlighted.

1538,WOS:000418219000015,"In recent years, cities in some water stressed regions have explored alternative water sources such as seawater desalination and potable water recycling in spite of concerns over increasing energy consumption. In this study, we evaluate the current and future life-cycle energy impacts of four alternative water supply strategies introduced during a decade-long drought in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. These strategies were: seawater desalination, indirect potable water recycling, network integration, and rainwater tanks. Our work highlights the energy burden of alternative water supply strategies which added approximately 24% life-cycle energy use to the existing supply system (with surface water sources) in SEQ even for a current post-drought low utilisation status. Over half of this additional life-cycle energy use was from the centralised alternative supply strategies. Rainwater tanks contributed an estimated 3% to regional water supply, but added over 10% life-cycle energy use to the existing system. In the future scenario analysis, we compare the life-cycle energy use between ""Normal"", ""Dry"", ""High water demand"" and ""Design capacity"" scenarios. In the ""Normal"" scenario, a long-term low utilisation of the desalination system and the water recycling system has greatly reduced the energy burden of these centralised strategies to only 13%. In contrast, higher utilisation in the unlikely ""Dry"" and ""Design capacity"" scenarios add 86% and 140% to life-cycle energy use of the existing system respectively. In the ""High water demand"" scenario, a 20% increase in per capita water use over 20 years ""consumes"" more energy than is used by the four alternative strategies in the ""Normal"" scenario. This research provides insight for developing more realistic long-term scenarios to evaluate and compare life-cycle energy impacts of drought-adaptation infrastructure and regional decentralised water sources. Scenario building for life-cycle assessments of water supply systems should consider i) climate variability and, therefore, infrastructure utilisation rate, ii) potential under-utilisation for both installed centralised and decentralised sources, and iii) the potential energy penalty for operating infrastructure well below its design capacity (e.g., the operational energy intensity of the desalination system is three times higher at low utilisation rates). This study illustrates that evaluating the life-cycle energy use and intensity of these type of supply sources without considering their realistic long-term operating scenario(s) can potentially distort and overemphasise their energy implications. To other water stressed regions, this work shows that managing long-term water demand is also important, in addition to acknowledging the energy intensive nature of some alternative water sources.

However, inadequate information on the benefits from energy efficiency improvements has given street lighting systems a lower priority in national energy efficiency policy. This paper estimates the national benefits arising from energy efficiency improvements on street lighting systems based on a pilot project in Jakarta city and energy audits in other three cities. The energy efficiency actions considered in the audits are the installation of power meters on every panel in street lighting systems and the replacement of old, inefficient armatures with high-efficiency armatures that are integrated with the dimming schemes featured in smart street lighting technology. The results show that electricity consumption reduction potential from energy efficiency improvements can reach 2.1 Terra Watts hours annually. This is equivalent to energy costs of USD 177.4 million, a USD 46.8 million energy subsidy saving, and a 2.4 million ton CO2e, emission reduction. These findings can provide policymakers with important inputs while undertaking a social cost-benefit analysis of energy efficiency improvements in street lighting systems.

In this paper, we calculate environmental savings by applying a carbon footprint analysis to three food policies implemented by the City of Turin (Italy) in the school catering service (school years 2012/13 and 2013/14). The policies are focused on (I) the production of food (with the requirement of integrated or organic products), (II) the geographical origin of the food (with the requirement of regional food provisioning) and (III) the improvement of urban distribution (with the requirement of shifting to natural gas vehicles). The climate change potential of five of the most consumed foods were studied according to three main phases of the supply chain: production (including all processes in a cradle-to-gate perspective), provisioning (focusing on the transportation from production sites to the peripheral food hubs of the city), and distribution (focusing on the transportation from the city hubs to schools). The results of this study highlight the different climate impacts of the three phases of the supply chain, in particular 61-70% of the greenhouse gases are emitted in the production phase, 6-11% in the provisioning phase and 24-28% in urban distribution. As a consequence, policies that affect production practices have the greatest potential for reducing the carbon footprint of the catering service. Other policies (such as those on transportation) can have controversial effects. Therefore, to improve planning of sustainability policies, the greenhouse gas emission savings achieved by each policy must be analysed in-depth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

1544,WOS:000324013600031,"Shifting to renewable sources of electricity is imperative in achieving global reductions in carbon emissions and ensuring future energy security. One technology, solar photovoltaics (PV), has begun to generate a noticeable contribution to the electricity mix in numerous countries. However, the upper limits of this contribution have not been explored in a way that combines both building-by-building solar resource appraisals with the city-scale socio-economic contexts that dictate PV uptake. This paper presents such a method, whereby a 'Solar City Indicator' is calculated and used to rank cities by their capacity to generate electricity from roof-mounted PV. Seven major UK cities were chosen for analysis based on available data; Dundee, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. The physical capacity of each city was established using a GIS-based methodology, exploiting digital surface models and LiDAR data, with distinct methodologies for large and small properties. Socio-economic factors (income, education, environmental consciousness, building stock and ownership) were chosen based on existing literature and correlation with current levels of PV installations. These factors were enumerated using data that was readily available across each city. Results show that Derby has the greatest potential of all the cities analysed, as it offers both good physical and socio-economic potential. In terms of physical capacity it was seen that over a 15 year payback period there are two plateaus, showing a marked difference in viability between small and large PV arrays. It was found that both the physical and socio-economic potential of a city are strongly influenced by the nature of the local building stock. This study also identifies areas where policy needs to be focused in order to encourage uptake and highlights factors limiting maximum PV uptake. While this methodology has been demonstrated using UK cities, it is equally applicable to any country where city data is available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These two critical resources are inextricably and reciprocally linked; the production of energy requires large volumes of water, while the treatment and distribution of water is also significantly dependent upon energy. In this paper, a hybrid analysis approach is proposed to estimate embodied energy and to perform a structural path analysis of drinking water supply systems. The applicability of this approach is then tested through a case study of a large municipal water utility (city of Kalamazoo) in the Great Lakes region to provide insights on the issues of water-energy pricing and carbon footprints. Kalamazoo drinking water requires approximately 9.2 MJ/m(3) of energy to produce, 30% of which is associated with indirect inputs such as system construction and treatment chemicals.","Mo, WW, Nasiri, F, Eckelman, MJ, Zhang, Q, Zimmerman, JB",37,Kalamazoo,USA,10.1021/es1015845,SRID=4326;POINT (-85.58723000000001 42.29171),76041,Measuring the Embodied Energy in Drinking Water Supply Systems: A Case Study in The Great Lakes Region,2010

To better understand soil structure formation over time and the effects of land use change on surface and subsurface hydrology, we quantified the effects of urban land development and subsequent soil rehabilitation on soil aggregate size distribution and aggregate-associated C and their links to soil hydraulic conductivity. Four treatments [typical practice (A horizon removed, subsoil compacted, A horizon partially replaced), enhanced topsoil (same as typical practice plus tillage), post-development rehabilitated soils (compost incorporation to 60-cm depth in subsoil; A horizon partially replaced plus tillage), and pre-development (undisturbed) soils] were applied to 24 plots in Virginia, USA. All plots were planted with five tree species. After five years, undisturbed surface soils had 26 to 48% higher levels of macroaggregation and 12 to 62% greater macroaggregate-associated C pools than those disturbed by urban land development regardless of whether they were stockpiled and replaced, or tilled. Little difference in aggregate size distribution was observed among treatments in subsurface soils, although rehabilitated soils had the greatest macroaggregate-associated C concentrations and pool sizes. Rehabilitated soils had 48 to 171% greater macroaggregate-associated C pool than the other three treatments. Surface hydraulic conductivity was not affected by soil treatment (ranging from 0.4 to 23 cm h(-1)). In deeper regions, post-development rehabilitated soils had about twice the saturated hydraulic conductivity (14.8 and 63 cm h(-1) at 10-25 cm and 25-40 cm, respectively) of undisturbed soils and approximately 6-11 times that of soils subjected to typical land development practices. Despite limited effects on soil aggregation, rehabilitation that includes deep compost incorporation and breaking of compacted subsurface layers has strong potential as a tool for urban stormwater mitigation and soil management should be explicitly considered in urban stormwater policy.

1547,WOS:000331421800068,"In contrast to the ever-increasing focus on China's CO2 emissions, little attention has been given to its CH4 emissions, the second largest greenhouse gas. Presented in this paper is a comprehensive assessment of the CH4 emissions in Mainland China by source and region based on the latest statistical data and research literatures available. The total CH4 emission in China 2007 is estimated as 38.6 Tg, one and a half times of that in USA. Even by the lower IPCC global warming potential (GWP) factor of 25, it corresponds to 964.1 Mt CO2-eq, in magnitude up to one seventh of China's CO2 emission and greater than the nationwide gross CO2 emissions in Australia, Canada, and Germany in 2007. As the leading emission source, energy activities are responsible for 45.3% of the total emission, agricultural activities contribute a comparable share of 40.9%, followed by waste management of 13.8%. Among all the 11 major emission sources, coal mining (38.3% of the total), enteric fermentation (21.4%) and rice cultivation (14.4%) essentially shape the CH4 emission profile for China, quite different from that for USA which is characterized by prominent emissions from enteric fermentation, municipal solid waste landfill and natural gas leakage. The Western and Central areas contribute 70.9% of the total nationwide emission and Shanxi is the largest regional CH4 emitter with an amount of 4.6 Tg. The five regions of Xizang (Tibet), Shanxi, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Guizhou are identified with the largest emissions per-capita and emission intensities. In contrast to the focused areas of CO2 emission reduction mainly in the energy-intensive eastern regions, the mitigation potential of CH4 emissions in the western and central regions is huge by integrating emission quantity and structure with emission per-capita and emission intensity at the regional level.

Previously, many carsharing companies determined service locations through trial and error, but they currently define their parking locations in metropolitan cities for maximum customer coverage. However, identifying carsharing locations according to the experiences of the pioneering cities might not yield valid results in some Asian countries where carsharing systems are unknown. Hence, this study examines the characteristics of carsharing users in Daejeon, a small Korean city, to determine that city's optimal carsharing service locations. A geographic information system was used to analyze and determine the best spatial areas according to two data categories: internal and external demand factors. Suitable carsharing locations were ranked by the results of a grid analysis. Thirty optimal locations were then determined from the location-allocation model in a network analysis module. Determining optimal carsharing locations should also be directly correlated with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide emission reduction from carsharing was predicted at 62,070 tCO2eq for the year 2013; emission reductions were predicted to increase further to 172,923 tCO2eq by 2020. Thus, carsharing is an innovative strategy for traffic demand management that can alleviate air pollution. The results of this study indicate that further research is necessary to examine the relationship between optimal carsharing locations and carbon dioxide emission reduction from using lower-emission carsharing vehicles, such as electric vehicles.","Lee, JB, Byun, W, Lee, SH, Do, M",7,Daejeon,KOR,10.1007/s13762-014-0640-x,SRID=4326;POINT (127.41972 36.32139),1475221,Correlation between optimal carsharing locations and carbon dioxide emissions in urban areas,2014

The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of urban residents on the health co-benefits involving GHG abatement and related influencing factors in three cities in China. Beijing, Ningbo and Guangzhou were selected for this survey. Participants were recruited from randomly chosen committees, following quotas for gender and age in proportion to the respective population shares. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were employed to examine the associations between socio-demographic variables and individuals' perceptions of the health co-benefits related to GHG mitigation. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the influencing factors of respondents' awareness about the health co-benefits. A total of 1159 participants were included in the final analysis, of which 15.9% reported that they were familiar with the health co-benefits of GHG emission reductions. Those who were younger, more educated, with higher family income, and with registered urban residence, were more likely to be aware of health co-benefits. Age, attitudes toward air pollution and governmental efforts to improve air quality, suffering from respiratory diseases, and following low carbon lifestyles are significant predictors of respondents' perceptions on the health co-benefits.

1550,WOS:000398771100014,"Purpose The aim of this study is to compare the life cycle energy and costs derived from the production and occupation of social interest housing models located in two different types of neighborhoods: compact and sprawling. Two neighborhood development alternatives in Mexico City were established and evaluated including the potential impacts analysis of the built environment/infrastructure and the commuting of the occupants. Methods The study includes the conventional phases of a building life cycle (LC)-preoccupation, occupation, and post-occupation-but it was expanded to include a fourth phase, ""occupant transportation,"" to cover the commuting potential impacts. The methodology consists of four main stages: (1) definition of function, functional unit, and scope; (2) data collection-divided in three main steps: architectural, land costs and transformations, and commuting data; (3) impact assessment-we used software SimaPro v8.0.1 to manage the LC inventory data; and (4) interpretation of results and sensitivity analysis. Results and discussion In the preoccupation phase, the sprawling neighborhood cell (NC) cumulative energy demand (CED) is 30 % larger than the compact NC ones. Regarding the LC costs, land costs strongly impact the compact NC, but when aggregated in the preoccupation phase, the LC costs for the sprawling NC are only 14 % above those of the compact NC. For the occupation phase, results show that the compact NC has lower CED (by 10 %) and LC costs (16 %) than the sprawling NC. The occupant transportation phase plays a highly important role, since it represents up to 28 % of total LC CED and up to 54 % of total LC costs. This phase affects significantly the sprawling NC, which has a 25% higher CED and doubles LC costs, when compared with the compact NC. Post-occupation phase contributes just in a small proportion of the total CED and LC costs for both NC, since it accounts for 3 % or less of the total energy and LC costs. Overall results show that the compact NC has lower CED and LC costs than the sprawling NC. Conclusions The results show that occupant transportation phase plays a highly important role in the neighborhood performance. Neighborhood development assessment should consider a number of variables beyond CED and costs. However, in order to improve the sector's energy efficiency and household's economy, we recommend to consider house location as it can be as important as other energy or cost-reduction actions in neighborhood development.",,1,Mexico City,MEX,10.1007/s11367-016-1100-2,SRID=4326;POINT (-99.12766000000001 19.42847),12294193,Life cycle energy and costs of sprawling and compact neighborhoods,2017

Limited by scaling and data uncertainties, geographical allocation of carbon-emitting responsibilities or burdens at local or fine scales has not been well documented. In this regard, after estimating total carbon emissions from urban motor and metro transports, we proposed a multiproxy allocation system that included a series of transport-related demand and supply indicators. On the basis of urban high-resolution data, magnitudes of gridded proxies in fine scales were aggregated into each local administrative region (subdistrict and town) by a bottom-up approach. Then, weights of these indicators were calculated through an integration of Grey Relational Analysis with Fuzzy Logic. Finally, using the practical scenario of Wuhan (China), we allocated total carbon emitting quantities from the Wuhan metropolis down to local units by using a top-down approach. Local carbon-emitting contributions and their variations were further identified and mapped from total, per capita, and per unit perspectives. We have not only shown this allocative approach to be effective and applicable, but have also depicted spatially similar patterns and evolutions under the three carbon-emitting indicators. These depictions include local inequality and polarization, core-peripheral structure, place-dependence on initial location, and spatial locking-in effect and diffusive trends along metro lines. Additionally, spatial differences between the per capita carbon emission and the others are revealed as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Local authorities all over UK establish community farms with the aim to produce more sustainable food for citizens. This study used environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify the potential savings of food-related GHG emissions that may be achieved with the establishment of an urban community farm, based on a case study recently found in the London Borough of Sutton. The work identified elements of the farm design that require the greatest attention to maximise these savings. The greatest reductions can be achieved by selecting the right crops: (i) providing the highest yields in local conditions and (ii) usually produced in energy-intensive greenhouses or air-freighted to UK from outside Europe. Implications from further development of the farm on the local, unused land were examined, taking into account market requirements. This showed that land used on an urban fringe for food production could potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Sutton by up to 34 t CO(2)e ha(-1) a(-1).

Empirical results show that the main obstacle that hinders China's transition to a green energy economy is the economic structure characterized by high carbon emissions. In contrast, the increased proportion of renewable energy sources (RES) and the improvement of energy efficiency play a more important role in reducing carbon emissions. Moreover, the power sector has a pivotal position in CO2 emissions reduction, primarily because of the expansion of electricity consumption.

The aim of this research was to study pervious concrete pavement as a sustainable solution to control the stormwater at source, reducing heat island effect and enhancing safety of driving. The sustainability of pervious concrete can be increased and the carbon dioxide emissions reduced by replacing a huge amount of ordinary Portland cement with waste materials such as palm oil fuel ash. Palm oil fuel ash is a waste material obtained from the combustion of oil palm shells and fibers in palm oil industry to produce electricity, which caused environmental problems in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. This study presented experimental investigations to assess the substitution of control pervious concrete with palm oil fuel ash up to 40% (by mass) to produce sustainable and eco-friendly pervious concrete pavement. Density and void content of specimens were determined at fresh and hardened-state. Falling head permeability test was carried out to investigate the stormwater filtration capacity. Compressive and tensile strengths were conducted on pervious concrete specimens. Skid and abrasion resistances were also employed to evaluate the effects of palm oil fuel ash on safety of driving and surface durability of the pervious concrete pavement. The results showed that void content and water permeability of pervious concrete increased slightly with increasing palm oil fuel ash, while compressive and tensile strengths decreased. They satisfy the typical range for pervious concrete according to American Concrete Institute. A minor effect of palm oil fuel ash on the skid resistance was observed, increasing its substitution levels caused the abrasion resistance of pervious concrete mixtures to decrease. The heavy metal concentrations in leachates of the pervious concrete containing 40% palm oil fuel ash were significantly lower than recommended in the standard. The pervious concrete containing 20% palm oil fuel ash presented the most optimum mixture both technically and environmentally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies suggest that urban forests may represent an important carbon reservoir. However, the potential to directly remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by urban vegetation is still poorly supported by scientific evidence. Current assessments consider only the carbon accumulated by trees and usually neglect the contribution from soil respiration and the emissions associated with greenery management. Studies in mid-latitude cities suggest that the carbon uptake by urban vegetation is small compared to the magnitude of the anthropogenic emissions. To investigate if the typically evergreen vegetation in (sub)tropical cities has a larger potential for carbon sequestration, the CO2 flux data from two residential neighborhoods of Singapore and Mexico City were analyzed. Results suggest that (sub)tropical vegetation may act as either an emission source or sink depending on the species and characteristics of the trees and the amount and conditions of pervious surfaces for soil respiration.

The problem is formulated as the maximization of the savings produced by the reduction in energy losses and the avoided costs due to investment deferral in the expansion of the network. The proposed method selects the nodes to be compensated, as well as the optimal capacitor ratings and their operational characteristics, i.e., fixed or switched. After an appropriate linearization, the optimization problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem, suitable for being solved by means of a widespread commercial package. Results of the proposed optimizing method are compared with another recent methodology reported in the literature using two test cases: a 15-bus and a 33-bus distribution network. For both cases tested, the proposed methodology delivers better solutions indicated by higher losses savings, which are achieved with lower amounts of capacitive compensation. To calculate exactly the energy savings and the deferral investment cost, a power flow for radial distribution networks is executed before and after the compensation. The proposed method has also been applied for compensating an actual radial distribution network served by AES-Venezuela in the metropolitan area of Caracas.

Yet little information exists for characterizing how quickly or slowly GHG emissions reductions will accrue given changes in urban form around transit and whether benefits will accrue quickly enough to meet policy year targets (such as reaching 20% of 1990 GHG emissions levels by 2050). Achieving GHG reductions through integrated transportation and land use planning is even more complicated for cities because changes in emissions can occur across many sectors (such as transportation, building energy use, and electricity generation). With the use of the Los Angeles, California, Expo Line, a framework was developed to assess how financing schemes could affect the rate of building redevelopment and resulting life-cycle GHG emissions from travel and building energy use. The framework leveraged an integrated transportation and land use life-cycle assessment model that captured upfront construction of new development near transit and the long-term changes in household energy use for travel and buildings. The results show that for the same amount of development around the Expo Line, it is possible either to meet state GHG goals by 2050 (if aggressive redevelopment happens early) or not meet those goals by 2050 (if significant redevelopment does not start for decades). The time-based approach reveals how redevelopment schedules should be considered when strategies for meeting future GHG emissions targets are set.","Nahlik, MJ, Chester, MV",1,Los Angeles,USA,10.3141/2502-07,SRID=4326;POINT (-118.24368 34.05223),3971883,Policy Making Should Consider Time-Dependent Greenhouse Gas Benefits of Transit-Oriented Smart Growth,2015
1562,WOS:000384412900010,"Assessment of mitigation strategies that combat global warming, urban heat islands (UHIs), and urban energy demand can be crucial for urban planners and energy providers, especially for hot, semi-arid urban environments where summertime cooling demands are excessive. Within this context, summertime regional impacts of cool roof and rooftop solar photovoltaic deployment on near-surface air temperature and cooling energy demand are examined for the two major USA cities of Arizona: Phoenix and Tucson. A detailed physics-based parametrization of solar photovoltaic panels is developed and implemented in a multilayer building energy model that is fully coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale numerical model. We conduct a suite of sensitivity experiments (with different coverage rates of cool roof and rooftop solar photovoltaic deployment) for a 10-day clear-sky extreme heat period over the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas at high spatial resolution (1-km horizontal grid spacing). Results show that deployment of cool roofs and rooftop solar photovoltaic panels reduce near-surface air temperature across the diurnal cycle and decrease daily citywide cooling energy demand. During the day, cool roofs are more effective at cooling than rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, but during the night, solar panels are more efficient at reducing the UHI effect. For the maximum coverage rate deployment, cool roofs reduced daily citywide cooling energy demand by 13-14 %, while rooftop solar photovoltaic panels by 8-11 % (without considering the additional savings derived from their electricity production). The results presented here demonstrate that deployment of both roofing technologies have multiple benefits for the urban environment, while solar photovoltaic panels add additional value because they reduce the dependence on fossil fuel consumption for electricity generation.","Salamanca, F, Georgescu, M, Mahalov, A, Moustaoui, M, Martilli, A",4,Phoenix; Tucson,USA; USA,10.1007/s10546-016-0160-y,SRID=4326;POINT (-112.07404 33.44838); SRID=4326;POINT (-110.92648 32.22174),1563025; 531641,Citywide Impacts of Cool Roof and Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Deployment on Near-Surface Air Temperature and Cooling Energy Demand,2016

We analyze the role of electric utilities as important actors to catalyze the transition to electric cites, drawing upon data for the world's 27 megacities. Progress towards the ideal electric city is most advanced for Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires for low carbon electricity, while Indian megacities have relatively high use of carbon-intensive electricity as a percentage of total energy use. There is wide variety in the structure of markets for electricity provision in megacities, with a dominant, public utility being the most common model. We review literature on electricity sector business models and broadly propose future models dependent on the predominance of locally dispersed generation and the nature of the ownership of the electric grid within the city. Where a high proportion of electricity can be provided by locally distributed supply within a city, the role of utilities could predominantly become that of enabler of exchange with the grid, but new pricing structures are required.

The identification of the actual energy consumption profile of large building stocks is a necessary step to evaluate the impact of retrofit measures, e.g. energy savings, at city scale. The present study introduces a bottom-up statistical methodology based on a Geographical Information System (GIS) to estimate the energy consumption of residential stocks across an entire city. The adoption of a multiple linear regression model allows the downscaling of measured natural gas and electricity consumption from the aggregated post-code level to single dwellings, based on several descriptors, such as dwelling type, period of construction, floor surface and number of occupants. The energy consumption is apportioned to different end-uses and corrected for weather, then the energy savings potential is estimated by accounting for the implementation of typical refurbishment measures. Results are finally aggregated across the whole city for evidence-based decision support in sustainable urban planning. The study provided relevant results to prioritize the implementation of energy retrofit measures for the residential stock of Rotterdam city, consisting of about 300,000 dwellings.

The building prototypes included a detached one-story and a detached two-story single family house, as well as a row house. The simulations indicated that by increasing the vegetative cover of the neighborhood by 30% (corresponding to about three trees per house) and increasing the albedo of the houses by 20% (from moderate-dark to medium-light color), the heating energy in Toronto can be reduced by about 10% in urban houses and 20% in rural houses, whereas cooling energy can be reduced by 40 and 30%, respectively. The annual savings in heating and cooling costs for different houses ranged from $30 to $180 in urban areas and from $60 to $400 in rural zones.

A survey of 1000 street vendors in the metropolitan area reveals high levels of energy poverty, with vendors being forced to choose between inadequate lighting and expensive power from diesel generators operated by local entrepreneurs. The survey also shows that vendors consider improved lighting a top priority and believe that improved lighting could expand their business and attract customers. While vendors are generally aware of solar panels, a few are using this technology in the marketplaces.

This article presents a quantitative eco-efficiency (E/E) analysis on MSW management in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. A methodology for E/E analysis has been proposed, with an emphasis on the consistent integration of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). The environmental and economic impacts derived from LCA and LCC have been normalized and defined as a quantitative E/E indicator. The proposed method was applied in a case study of Tianjin, China. The study assessed the current MSW management system, as well as a set of alternative scenarios, to investigate trade-offs between economy and GHG emissions mitigation. Additionally, contribution analysis was conducted on both LCA and LCC to identify key issues driving environmental and economic impacts. The results show that the current Tianjin's MSW management system emits the highest GHG and costs the least, whereas the situation reverses in the integrated scenario. The key issues identified by the contribution analysis show no linear relationship between the global warming impact and the cost impact in MSW management system. The landfill gas utilization scenario is indicated as a potential optimum scenario by the proposed E/E analysis, given the characteristics of MSW, technology levels, and chosen methodologies. The E/E analysis provides an attractive direction towards sustainable waste management, though some questions with respect to uncertainty need to be discussed further. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, climate change and its effects on buildings energy performance represent a critical issue, also considering the implications of climate change on human comfort. Starting from this, the present study aims at analyzing the climatic conditions in Rome and its surroundings, evaluating the occurrence of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. Therefore, meteorological data derived from two airports near the city and climatic data registered for two years in a central, densely-built zone of Rome were analyzed and compared. Furthermore, the differences among weather data were tested by means of a commonly used dynamic software in order to evaluate the effects of different climatic boundary conditions on building energy performance, in terms of heating and cooling energy demands. The results highlight significant differences with regard to temperature, wind velocity and relative humidity, as a result of a prevailing UHI phenomenon in central Rome throughout the year.

Besides, due to the existence of self-selection effects, the observed interrelationship between them might be the spurious result of the fact that some unobserved variables are causing both. These concerns motivate us to (1) consider residential location choice and household energy consumption behavior (for both in-home appliances and out-of-home cars) simultaneously and, (2) explicitly control self-selection effects so as to capture a relatively true effect of land-use policy on household energy consumption behavior.

Rates of evaporation-interception for a single layer with multiple surface types (paved, buildings, coniferous trees and/or shrubs, deciduous trees and/or shrubs, irrigated grass, non-irrigated grass and water) are calculated. Below each surface type, except water, there is a single soil layer. At each time step the moisture state of each surface is calculated. Horizontal water movements at the surface and in the soil are incorporated. Particular attention is given to the surface conductance used to model evaporation and its parameters. The model is tested against direct flux measurements carried out over a number of years in Vancouver. Canada and Los Angeles, USA. At all measurement sites the model is able to simulate the net all-wave radiation and turbulent sensible and latent heat well (RMSE = 25-47 W m(-2), 30-64 and 20-56 W m(-2), respectively). The model reproduces the diurnal cycle of the turbulent fluxes but typically underestimates latent heat flux and overestimates sensible heat flux in the day time. The model tracks measured surface wetness and simulates the variations in soil moisture content. It is able to respond correctly to short-term events as well as annual changes. The largest uncertainty relates to the determination of surface conductance. The model has the potential be used for multiple applications; for example, to predict effects of regulation on urban water use, landscaping and planning scenarios, or to assess climate mitigation strategies.

1578,WOS:000418262400041,"Raised-bed plasticulture, an intensive production system used around the world for growing high-value crops (e.g., fresh market vegetables), faces a water-food nexus that is actually a food-water-energy-landeconomic nexus. Plasticulture represents a multibillion dollar facet of the United States crop production value annually and must become more efficient to be able to produce more on less land, reduce water demands, decrease impacts on surrounding environments, and be economically-competitive. Taller and narrower futuristic beds were designed with the goal of making plasticulture more sustainable by reducing input requirements and associated wastes (e.g., water, nutrients, pesticides, costs, plastics, energy), facilitating usage of modern technologies (e.g., drip-based fumigation), improving adaptability to a changing climate (e.g., flood protection), and increasing yield per unit area. Compact low-input beds were analyzed against conventional beds for the plasticulture production of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), an economically-important crop, using a systems approach involving field measurements, vadose-zone modeling (HYDRUS), and production analysis. Three compact bed geometries, 61 cm (width) x 25 cm (height), 45 cm x 30 cm, 41 cm x 30 cm, were designed and evaluated against a conventional 76 cm x 20 cm bed. A two-season field study was conducted for tomato in the ecologicallysensitive and productive Everglades region of Florida. Compact beds did not statistically impact yield and were found to reduce: 1) production costs by $ 150-$450/ha; 2) leaching losses by up to 5% (1 cm/ha water, 0.33 kg/ha total nitrogen, 0.05 kg/ha total phosphorus); 3) fumigant by up to 47% (48 kg/ha); 4) plasticulture's carbon footprint by up to 10% (1711 kg CO2 -eq/ha) and plastic waste stream by up to 13% (27 kg/ ha); 5) flood risks and disease pressure by increasing field's soil water storage capacity by up to 33% (approximate to 1 cm); and 6) field runoffby 0.48-1.40 cm (51-76%) based on HYDRUS model simulations of 10year, 2-h storm events in other major tomato production regions of California and Virginia. Re-designing the bed geometries in plasticulture production systems to be more compact is an example of win-win production optimization not only for traditional farms in rural areas but also for urban and peri-urban farms which are located closer to city centers. Compact beds could enable more plants per unit area, thus requiring less land area for the same production. Needing less area facilitates urban and peri-urban farming where land values can be high. Urban and peri-urban farming has several benefits, including reductions in transportation energy as production is closer to market and the ability for city wastewater to be reused for irrigation instead of freshwater withdrawals. Compact beds allow plasticulture to have smaller water, chemical, energy, carbon, waste, and economic footprints without impacting production. Improving agricultural systems in this way could enhance economic and environmental viability, which is essential for a sustainable food-water-energy-land-economic nexus.

The GHG emissions varied substantially with time and were regulated by temperature, moisture content and the waste properties, indicating the potential to mitigate GHG emission through proper management of the composting systems. In comparison with other mainstream municipal waste management options including centralized composting and anaerobic digestion facilities, landfilling and incineration, home composting has the potential to reduce GHG emissions through both lower on-site emissions and the minimal need for transportation and processing. On account of the lower cost, the present results suggest that home composting provides an effective and feasible supplementary waste management method to a centralized facility in particular for cities with lower population density such as the Australian cities.","Chan, YC, Sinha, RK, Wang, WJ",22,Brisbane,AUS,10.1177/0734242X10375587,SRID=4326;POINT (153.02809 -27.46794),2189878,"Emission of greenhouse gases from home aerobic composting, anaerobic digestion and vermicomposting of household wastes in Brisbane (Australia)",2011

China during 2005-2020 using a long-term least cost vehicular mix model. It also examines the implications of the nitrogen oxides emission reduction targets (NERTs) for greenhouse gas and other local pollutant emissions. The study is limited to the passenger transportation in the city and does not consider freight transportation options. A key finding of this study is that the liquefied petroleum gas buses would replace diesel buses in Beijing at NERT of 10% while the shares of other transport options would remain unaffected. At higher NERT of 20-50%, hybrid cars and electric trolley buses would be cost effective. It is also found that total cost would increase only marginally (by less than 0.1%) up to the emission reduction target of 10% whereas it would increase by as high as 31.7% when the target is increased to 50%. Total energy requirement would not change much at lower values of NERT (e.g., 10%). However, it would decrease as the emission reduction target is set at 20% or higher. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A simplified case study based on the city of Perth, Australia was used to estimate the savings that could be achieved by water banking. Scenarios for investment in seawater desalination plants and groundwater replenishment were considered over a 20 year period of growing demand, using a Monte Carlo analysis that embedded the Markov model. An optimisation algorithm identified the minimum cost solutions that met specified criteria for supply reliability. The impact of depreciation of recharge credits was explored. The results revealed savings of more than A$1B (similar to US$1B) or 37% to 33% of supply augmentation costs by including water banking in aquifers for 95% and 99.5% reliability of supply respectively. When the hypothetically assumed recharge credit depreciation rate was increased from 1% p.a. to 10% p.a. savings were still 33% to 31% for the same reliabilities. These preliminary results show that water banking in aquifers has potential to offer a highly attractive solution for efficiently increasing the security of urban water supplies where aquifers are suitable.","Gao, L, Connor, JD, Dillon, P",10,Perth,AUS,10.3390/w6061662,SRID=4326;POINT (115.8614 -31.95224),1896548,The Economics of Groundwater Replenishment for Reliable Urban Water Supply,2014

1583,WOS:000341608900011,"In order to estimate a country-scale soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change in agricultural lands in Japan, while taking into account the effect of land-use changes, climate, different agricultural activities and the nature of soils, a spatially explicit model simulation system was developed using Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC) with an integration of spatial and temporal inventories. Simulation was run from 1970 to 2008 with historical inventories. Simulated SOC stock was compared with observations in a nation-wide stationary monitoring program conducted during 1979-1998. Historical land-use change, characterized by a large decline in the area of paddy fields as well as a small but continuous decline in the area of orchards, occurred along with a relatively large increase in upland crop fields, unmanaged grasslands, and settlements (i.e. conversion of agricultural fields due to urbanization or abandoning). Results of the simulation on SOC stock change under varying land-use change indicated that land-use conversion from agricultural fields to settlements or other lands, as well as that from paddy fields to croplands have likely been an increasing source of CO2 emission, due to the reduction of organic carbon input to soils and the enhancement of SOC decomposition through transition of soil environment from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. The area-weighted mean concentrations of the simulated SOC stocks calculated for major soil groups under paddy fields and upland crop fields were comparable to those observed in the monitoring. Whereas in orchards, the simulated SOC stocks were underestimated. As the results of simulation indicated that SOC stock change under managed grasslands and settlements has been likely a major sink and source of CO2 emission at country-scale, respectively, validation of SOC stock change under these land-use types, which could not have been accomplished due to limited availability or a lack of measurement, remains a forthcoming challenge.","Yagasaki, Y, Shirato, Y",6,Roth,DEU,10.5194/bg-11-4429-2014,SRID=4326;POINT (11.09111 49.24762),25083,Assessment on the rates and potentials of soil organic carbon sequestration in agricultural lands in Japan using a process-based model and spatially explicit land-use change inventories - Part 1: Historical trend and validation based on nation-wide soil monitoring,2014

In this study, metal concentrations in shrimps Crangon affinis indicated that two typical sites (S6283 and S5283) close to Longkou and Zhaoyuan cities along the Laizhou Bay have been contaminated by metals, including Cd, As, Cu, Ni, Co, and Mn. In particular, Cd and As were the main metal contaminants in S6283. In S5283, however, Cu was the most important metal contaminant. The metabolic responses in the shrimps indicated that the metal pollution in S6283 and 55283 induced disturbances in osmotic regulation and energy metabolism and reduced anaerobiosis, lipid metabolism, and muscle movement. However, alteration, in the levels of dimethylglycine, dimethylamine, arginine, betaine, and glutamine indicated that the metal pollution in S5283 induced osmotic stress through different pathways compared to that in S6283.

1585,WOS:000313551500005,"Background: Achieving health benefits while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport offers a potential policy win-win; the magnitude of potential benefits, however, is likely to vary. This study uses an Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling tool (ITHIM) to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of high walking and cycling transport scenarios for English and Welsh urban areas outside London. Methods: Three scenarios with increased walking and cycling and lower car use were generated based upon the Visions 2030 Walking and Cycling project. Changes to carbon dioxide emissions were estimated by environmental modelling. Health impact assessment modelling was used to estimate changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from changes in exposure to air pollution, road traffic injury risk, and physical activity. We compare the findings of the model with results generated using the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment of Transport (HEAT) tools. Results: This study found considerable reductions in disease burden under all three scenarios, with the largest health benefits attributed to reductions in ischemic heart disease. The pathways that produced the largest benefits were, in order, physical activity, road traffic injuries, and air pollution. The choice of dose response relationship for physical activity had a large impact on the size of the benefits. Modelling the impact on all-cause mortality rather than through individual diseases suggested larger benefits. Using the best available evidence we found fewer road traffic injuries for all scenarios compared with baseline but alternative assumptions suggested potential increases. Conclusions: Methods to estimate the health impacts from transport related physical activity and injury risk are in their infancy; this study has demonstrated an integration of transport and health impact modelling approaches. The findings add to the case for a move from car transport to walking and cycling, and have implications for empirical and modelling research.","Woodcock, J, Givoni, M, Morgan, AS",63,London,GBR,10.1371/journal.pone.0051462,SRID=4326;POINT (-0.12574 51.50853),7556900,Health Impact Modelling of Active Travel Visions for England and Wales Using an Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool (ITHIM),2013

The cost of lactation may be met by reduction in energy expenditure, including reduced physical activity, as well as by mobilization of bodily soft tissue. However, daily energy expenditure of lactating women has been shown to increase across the course of lactation among women in a rural population in the Philippines and an urban population in India, with a decline in body weight across the course of lactation in both studies. In the present study, total daily energy expenditure and anthropometric body composition were measured longitudinally in 68 mothers from a poor urban area of Dhaka, Bangladesh, at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 months of lactation, to determine whether the increasing energy expenditure across lactation observed elsewhere also occurs in Bangladeshi women. In addition, the extent to which an extended period of lactation was accompanied by weight and body fat change in these women was determined. Energy expenditure by heart-rate monitoring and activity report, and body composition from anthropometry was carried out four times across the 8-month period of lactation.

1588,WOS:000303912300007,"Background: This paper examines the cost and benefits, both financial and environmental, of two leading forms of solar power generation, grid-tied photovoltaic cells and Dish Stirling Systems, using conventional carbon-based fuel as a benchmark. Methods: First we define how these solar technologies will be implemented and why. Then we delineate a model city and its characteristics, which will be used to test the two methods of solar-powered electric distribution. Then we set the constraining assumptions for each technology, which serve as parameters for our calculations. Finally, we calculate the present value of the total cost of conventional energy needed to power our model city and use this as a benchmark when analyzing both solar models' benefits and costs. Results: The preeminent form of distributed electricity generation, grid-tied photovoltaic cells under net-metering, allow individual homeowners a degree of electric self-sufficiency while often turning a profit. However, substantial subsidies are required to make the investment sensible. Meanwhile, large dish Stirling engine installations have a significantly higher potential rate of return, but face a number of pragmatic limitations. Conclusions: This paper concludes that both technologies are a sensible investment for consumers, but given that the dish Stirling consumer receives 6.37 dollars per watt while the home photovoltaic system consumer receives between 0.9 and 1.70 dollars per watt, the former appears to be a superior option. Despite the large investment, this paper deduces that it is far more feasible to get few strong investors to develop a solar farm of this magnitude, than to get 150,000 households to install photovoltaic arrays in their roofs. Potential implications of the solar farm construction include an environmental impact given the size of land require for this endeavour. However, the positive aspects, which include a large CO2 emission reduction aggregated over the lifespan of the farm, outweigh any minor concerns or potential externalities.","Banoni, VA, Arnone, A, Fondeur, M, Hodge, A, Offner, JP, Phillips, JK",2,Stirling,GBR,10.1186/1752-153X-6-S1-S6,SRID=4326;POINT (-3.93682 56.11903),33012,The place of solar power: an economic analysis of concentrated and distributed solar power,2012
1589,WOS:000364543500005,"Nationwide rapid urbanization has been a key driver of economic growth, energy consumption, and carbon emission in China. To avoid the high energy consumption and pollution present in other industrialized countries, China is making the economic and social transition from a high-carbon model to a low-carbon model. The low-carbon city pilots (LCCPs) programme was launched by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to resolve the dilemma between economic development and transitioning to a low-carbon model. The status quos of these pilots in different regions have set CO2 intensity per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 reduction targets, and CO2 discharge peak times. Traditional policies, including those aimed at improving energy efficiency, applying renewable energy, adjusting sector structure, and increasing carbon sequestration capacity, are being widely applied in the form of command-mandatory tools, market-economic tools, and voluntary tools. By summarizing these policies, low-carbon development plans, LCCP governments reports, and a case study focusing on Zhenjiang (practical experiences based on city features), this article proposes implications for how to achieve the LCCPs' low-carbon goals.Policy relevanceChina has launched a low-carbon city pilots (LCCPs) programme to promote its future low-carbon urbanization, but the cities concerned have not yet managed to achieve true low-carbon' status in terms of CO2 per unit of GDP and CO2 per capita.

1590,WOS:000176112700008,"The St. Lawrence River ranks 16(th) in the world rivers for its freshwater discharge into the ocean, but its particulate fluxes are relatively low due the upstream presence of the Great Lakes system. Using notably C-13 measurements in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at several stations along stream, earlier studies provided information on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes through the St. Lawrence, with some constraints on spatial trends with respect to the in situ DIC metabolism. Here, we further document annual DIC-fluxes and seasonal changes in DIC supplies and DIC-metabolism, downstream. Chemical and isotopic measurements were performed in 1998, on a biweekly basis, at four different sites. These sites represent respectively the Great Lakes outflow into the St. Lawrence system, supplies from two tributaries (one with a silicate-rich Precambrian bedrock, the other with a carbonate-rich Paleozoic bedrock), and the St. Lawrence outflow into the maritime estuarine system. The 1998 survey yielded a total annual DIC flux of similar to6 x 10(12) to 7 x 10(12) g of carbon at the Quebec City outlet, about 40% higher than estimates from earlier studies. This represents about 1.5% of the world river DIC supplies to the ocean. Very strong seasonal variations are observed between the summer low water levels, when water supplies from the Great Lakes into the riverine system may represent up to 80% of the total outflow of the St. Lawrence River, and the spring snowmelt period, when tributaries may provide up to 80% of this outflow. delta(13)C-DIC values respond to this seasonal cycle, with near isotopic-equilibrium values with atmospheric CO2 during summer, and strongly depleted values in other seasons, notably during the spring high outflow period. This seasonal isotopic cycle is more pronounced at the Quebec City outlet, where the influence of 13 C-depleted DIC supplies from tributaries is stronger than upstream. The low delta(13)C-DIC values observed from fall to spring, may be due to a combination of the following factors: (i) enhanced supplies of C-13-depeleted DIC from soils and ground waters from watersheds, (ii) higher oxidation rates of dissolved or particulate (13) C-depleted organic carbon, and (iii) a reduced incidence of the in situ photosynthetic activity. The outflow and isotopic seasonal cycles result notably in a strong negative correlation between delta(13)C-DIC values and discharge rates. Estimates of DIC supplies from tributaries vs. those from the Great Lakes were calculated using either chemical or isotopic approaches. DIC supplies from tributaries vary between similar to5% and 60% of total DIC. Examination of pCO(2) data indicates a negligible seasonal variability at the Great Lakes outlet, with a mean annual value near equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. In contrast, strong seasonal changes are observed downstream, at Quebec City, with minimum pCO(2) values in summer and a mean annual value of similar to1300 ppmv, suggesting that the St. Lawrence River system in its later course acts as a source for atmospheric CO2, during most of the year.

Instead of grid augmentation, this study examined an alternative option of creating a power demand close to renewable sources and inducing population movements (i.e., Renewable Energy Exodus). First, the capacity of renewable energy to maintain populations in hilly and mountainous farming areas of japan was evaluated from two perspectives: Task (1) a challenging nationwide balance based on possible energy demand saving scenario for the future, and Task (2) a conservative nationwide balance based on the current per capita energy demand and on the region-by-region generation-consumption matching concept. Because Task (2) indicated that Hokkaido, the northern-most island, has a huge capacity, Task (3) was conducted for Hokkaido by examining both energy balance and economic evaluation including job creation for the following two scenarios: (A) a supply to Tokyo scenario and (B) a local demand generation scenario, keeping the same conservativeness as Task (2) by using the current data for energy consumption per capita. The nationwide Renewable Energy Exodus estimates gave 48 million people for Task (1) (with the future per capita energy demand) and 10 million people for Task (2) (with the current per capita energy demand and region-by-region self-sustained balance), respectively. For Hokkaido Task (3) (with an additional economic assessment) gave 1 million people. The Renewable Energy Exodus concept combined with the green economy promotion was found to have a significant merit for a sustainable future of countries like Japan where economic and social disparities are serious between urban areas and non-urban areas.

1593,WOS:000378446600026,"This study discusses the concept of natural and managerial disposability from their economic and methodological implications on social sustainability development. Then, it explores their analytical linkages to a concept on ""congestion."" The concept is classified into Undesirable Congestion (UC) under natural disposability and Desirable Congestion (DC) under managerial disposability. Considering the two disposability concepts, this study compares between Returns to Damage (RTD) under UC and Damages to Return (DTR) under DC Conceptually, UC and DC are conceptually different from RTD and DTR although they are closely related to each other group. An occurrence of the former measures is identified by a single negative multiplier (i.e. dual variable). In contrast, the latter measures are associated with multiple negative multipliers and an intercept of a supporting hyperplane on a production and pollution possibility set. Thus, an occurrence of UC and DC is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition on RTD and DTR, respectively, in terms of the number of negative multipliers on production factors. To document the practicality of the proposed, approach, this study applies it to Chinese economic and environmental assessment for its economic and energy planning for social sustainability development. This study identifies four important findings: First, the Chinese government has historically paid attention to the economic prosperity, but not paying serious attention on the environmental pollution (e.g., air pollution). Second, there was an increasing trend in improving the two components (Le., economic and environmental performance measures) regarding social sustainability. Third, China's economic and energy policy concerns have been focused upon well-developed municipalities (e.g., Beijing and Shanghai) and large provinces. Therefore, it is an important strategy for the government to allocate economic and energy resources to other provinces so that China can reduce the industrial and regional imbalances. As a result, China can enhance the level of social sustainability. Finally, the municipalities need strict regulation on traffic control in these metropolitan areas and a fuel mix shift from coal combustion to natural gas and renewable energies (e.g., solar, water, and nuclear generations). The fuel mix strategy, along with the structure change (e.g., from manufacturing to service and from public to private energy firms), will be a major industrial policy issue for China in near future.

1594,WOS:000341548600009,"The significant proportion of often abandoned marginal/enclosed agricultural land in city peripheries has given rise to the need for studying the delicate relationship between built-up areas and rural land. These issues are exacerbated where metropolitan settlement has no bounds and begins to invade the rural space juxtaposed between cities and urban areas. This marginal land, in particular where a minimum of agricultural activity persists, could provide support to urban activities for recreation, farm services and local production of goods, reducing energy consumption, greenhouse-gas emissions, global warming and packaging, conserving biodiversity. These actions will allow the composting and the reuse of treated waste waters for irrigation. In particular, urban agriculture can play an educational role by contributing to reducing crime and improving community/ethnic relations, encouraging time spent in the open air and ensuring food safety. This study describes a methodology related to the analysis, to the identification, of the residual agricultural areas, differentiating them in accordance with the various levels of rurality to indicate the models of use, which allow to enhance the local landscape situations (preservation of the agricultural function or insertion of integrated activities) obtaining the pertinent valorisation. This methodology has been applied to the metropolitan area in the North zone of Catania.

For example, the global warming and paroxysmal environmental problems induced by fossil energy consumption are highlighted in recent years. As a big energy consumption and carbon emission country, China has tried to establish and implement the carbon emission trading mechanism in order to adjust the economic development patterns, optimize the energy structure and fulfill the emission goals. This mechanism has played a certain role in guiding and supporting the energy saving and carbon emission reduction. With the wide popularization and acceptance of low-carbon and green development, the advantages and the benefits of regional carbon emission trading mechanism will gradually show up with more trading activities and enterprise participation. Therefore, it's imperative to explore the carbon emission trading mechanism and provide relative suggestions for government and enterprises. For analyzing the carbon emission trading mechanism in China, the development situations of economy, energy and policy were reviewed firstly. Then, based on the direct and indirect emissions, the carbon emission measurement method was used to study the emission trends of Beijing and pilot areas. With the system dynamics analysis Model, the key factors and evolution circuits influential to the carbon emission mechanism were identified from the aspects of society, energy, economy and environment. The factors were further selected by extended STIRPAT model and ridge regression model in order to construct the BP Neural Network prediction model of carbon emissions. Meanwhile, take Beijing as an example, seven different development scenarios were set to test the rational levels of carbon emissions in the next five years. At last, with the prediction and scenario analysis results, some policy advices were discussed and provided theoretical and practical references for reasonable and efficient carbon emission trading.

1596,WOS:000358458100030,"The advanced Princeton Roof Model (PROM) is evaluated and then applied to quantify the heat transferred through various modular roof structures over an entire year. The goal is to identify an optimal combination of roof reflectivity and insulation thickness that will reduce energy consumption and minimize cost. Meteorological data gathered over the Northeastern United States (Princeton, NJ) is used to force PROM. Our results reveal that for new constructions or for retrofits in the region, an R8.4 (around 46 cm thick roof insulation) white roof (assumed albedo =0.6 or greater) would significantly reduce the combined heating and cooling load attributable to the roofs. The wintertime penalty of white roofs is also shown to be insignificant compared to their summertime benefits. The findings are pertinent to many other densely populated areas with comparable climates where, despite a much higher number of heating versus cooling degree-days, white roofs are overall advantageous. A cost optimization analysis found that doubling, tripling and quadrupling the insulation thickness from the baseline case of 5.08 cm (2 in.), at an albedo of 0.45, requires 13, 17 and 19 years, respectively, to recover the additional cost incurred.

1597,WOS:000368207500021,"Energy production and consumption is a key element in future development which is influenced both by the technical possibilities available and by decision makers. Sustainability issues are closely linked in with energy policy, given the desire to increase the proportion of renewable energy. According to the Horizon 2020 climate and energy package, European Union (EU) member countries have to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit by 20%, to increase the proportion of renewable energy to 20% and to improve energy efficiency by 20% by 2020. In this study we aim to assess the opportunities available to exploit solar radiation on roofs with Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and photogrammetry techniques. The surveyed area was in Debrecen, the second largest city in Hungary. An aerial LiDAR survey was conducted with a density of 12 points/m(2), over a 7 x 1.8 km wide band. We extracted the building and roof models of the buildings from the point cloud. Furthermore, we applied a low-cost drone (DJI Phantom with a GoPro camera) in a smaller area of the LiDAR survey and also created a 3D model: buildings and roof planes were identified with multiresolution segmentation of the digital surface models (DSM) and orthophoto coverages. Building heights and building geometry were also extracted and validated in field surveys. 50 buildings were chosen for the geodetic survey and the results of the accuracy assessment were extrapolated to other buildings; in addition to this, 100 building heights were measured. We focused primarily on the roofs, as these surfaces offer possible locations for thermal and photovoltaic equipment. We determined the slope and aspect of roof planes and calculated the incoming solar energy according to roof planes before comparing the results of the point cloud processing of LiDAR data and the segmentation of DSMs. Extracted roof geometries showed varying degrees of accuracy: the research proved that LiDAR-based roof-modelling is the best choice in residential areas, but the results of the drone survey did not differ significantly. Generally, both approaches can be applied, because the solar radiation values calculated were similar. The aerial techniques combined with the multiresolution processing demonstrated can provide a valuable tool to estimate potential solar energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

1598,WOS:000325465300014,"Urban areas are the main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Previous studies have identified the effectiveness of better urban design on mitigating climate change and land-use patterns in cities as important factors in reducing GHG by local governments. However, studies documenting the link between land-use and GHG emissions are scant. Therefore, this study explores the driving forces of land-use change and GHG emission increments in urban areas and investigates their correlations. The study area, Xinzhuang, is a satellite city of Taipei that has rapidly urbanized in the past few decades. Twenty-one potential variables were selected to determine the driving forces of land-use change and GHG emission increments by binomial logistic regression based on the investigation data of national land use in 1996 and 2007. The correlation of land-use change and GHG increments was examined by Spearman rank-order analysis. Results of logistic regression analysis identified that population and its increasing density rate are main driving forces on both land-use change and GHG increments. The Spearman rank correlation matrix indicates that fluctuating urbanization level is significantly correlated with the increase of total GHG emissions, the emissions of residence, commerce, and transportation sectors in neighborhoods; and the emissions of residence and transportation sectors seem closely connected to current urbanization level. The findings suggest that relationships among land-use, urbanization, and GHG emissions in urban areas vary greatly according to residence and transportation characteristics. Land-based mitigation may provide the most viable mechanism for reducing GHG emissions through residence and transportation sectors.","Liao, CH, Chang, CL, Su, CY, Chiueh, PT",17,Taipei,TWN,10.1007/s13762-012-0155-2,SRID=4326;POINT (121.53185 25.04776),7871900,Correlation between land-use change and greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas,2013

Encouraging car owners to shift transport mode from private car to public transport could achieve significant emissions reductions. This study estimate carbon emissions savings by shifting from private cars to public transport for shopping trips in urban China, using Shenyang, one of the largest cities in China, as a case study. Our results show that the average carbon emissions per shopper is 426.9 g, and the carbon emissions on weekends is 13% higher than weekdays. Moreover, shoppers travelling by private car emitted five times more carbon emission than those by public transport. We also found that car ownership gradually increased as accessibility to public transport decreased, and that more car owners chose to travel by private cars than public transport in areas with limited access. This study, thus, highlights the potential for high-quality public transport to reduce the transport sector's carbon emissions in urban China.","Li, J, Zhang, PY, Lo, K, Guo, M, Wang, M",3,Shenyang,CHN,10.3390/en80910043,SRID=4326;POINT (123.43278 41.79222),6255921,Reducing Carbon Emissions from Shopping Trips: Evidence from China,2015

The economic assessment presented in this paper is based on the technical modelling presented in part I of the study. OBF with CCS would lead to large reductions in CO2 emissions but also OBF without CCS would decrease emissions significantly due to decreased coke consumption. From economic point of view, other important consequences of OBF process are increased LPG or LNG (liquefied petroleum gas or liquefied natural gas) consumption, decreased electricity production (increased purchase from markets), required investments and CO2 transportation and storage costs. As CCS processes typically, especially application of OBF is a trade-off between decreased electricity production and decreased emissions. Therefore a correlation between CO2 price development and electricity price development is of interest. In this paper, several sensitivity analyses are presented with different prices for CO2, electricity and other parameters.

The general mood must be changed in favor of more innovation in order for German, and foreign, industries to consider Germany as an attractive production location also on the long term. However, no new ways can be opened up if the guiding concepts are risk avoidance and one hundred percent safety. If the country were reduced to examining new ideas only in the light of what could go wrong, this would spell stagnation. Consequently, the problem of an acceptable residual risk is in need of reassessment, reassessment, both by politicians and by the public at large. This also applies to regulatory changes. Monopolies in the energy sector, and ecological exceptions stemming from permits granted a long time ago, are not the best weapons in a struggle for Germany as an industrial location. Deregulating the supply of power transmitted by lines is one way of boosting the performance capability of the cer-man power economy. For the three biggest electricity generating utilities in the Federal Republic alone, cost savings in the wake of the rationalization programs published to date are likely to amount to more than DM 1 billion. This keeps Germany attractive as a location especially for energy-intensive industries, provided that national utilities lower their electricity rates accordingly under the pressure of competition. Given the transport costs and the limits of generating capacity abroad it is very unlikely that cross-border electricity deliveries will flood the Federal Republic in a foreseeable time frame. However, improved competitiveness of the German power economy, and the price reductions expected especially by large industrial electricity consumers, are but one side of the coin. The other side are disadvantages expected to arise to environmental protection and to tariff customers, such as industry wasting electricity once the rates dropped and an extra burden put on private households as a result of the privileges granted to large customers (cherry picking). Such negative consequences call be avoided, though, if competition within the power industry is enhanced on a broad base and backed by measures of environmental policy at the same time.

It is not easy, however, to simultaneously address both issues. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the optimal occupant behavior that can simultaneously reduce total energy consumption and improve the IEQ, using an energy simulation and optimization tool. This study also developed an integrated IEQ score by combining three different IEQ indices (i.e., thermal comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ), and visual comfort) for building users to easily understand the IEQ condition. To analyze the effects of occupant behavior by region, the education facility was selected as the target facility, and five target regions were selected considering the Koppen climate classification system and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Finally, a total of 5 x 1.01 x 10(22) occupant behavior combinations can be generated in the five target regions. As a result, among the four target variables (i.e., total energy consumption, thermal comfort, IAQ and visual comfort), the total energy consumption of the optimal solution was found to have changed most dramatically compared to that of the basic condition in terms of percentage (94.7%), due to its strong correlation with the overall occupant behavior (the highest correlation coefficient: 0.879). Therefore, it is shown that occupant behavior has more influence on the total energy consumption than on the three IEQ indices. Among the three IEQ indices, the IAQ of the optimal solution decreased most significantly compared to that of the basic condition (the highest reduction ratio: 4.04% in Ulsan), which indicates that the IAQ has more influences on the integrated IEQ score than thermal and visual comfort.

Some of the key factors that affect the risks to urban areas include climate change, the densification of assets within cities and the general expansion of urban areas. In this paper, we examine and compare quantitatively the impact of climate change and recent urban development patterns on the exposure of four European cities to pluvial flooding. In particular, we investigate the degree to which pluvial floods of varying severity and in different geographical locations are influenced to the same extent by changes in urban land cover and climate change. We have selected the European cities of Odense, Vienna, Strasbourg and Nice for analyses to represent different climatic conditions, trends in urban development and topographical characteristics. We develop and apply a combined remote-sensing and flood-modelling approach to simulate the extent of pluvial flooding for a range of extreme precipitation events for historical (1984) and present-day (2014) urban land cover and for two climate-change scenarios (i.e. representative concentration pathways, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Changes in urban land cover are estimated using Landsat satellite imagery for the period 1984-2014. We combine the remote-sensing analyses with regionally downscaled estimates of precipitation extremes of current and expected future climate to enable 2-D overland flow simulations and flood-hazard assessments. The individual and combined impacts of urban development and climate change are quantified by examining the variations in flooding between the different simulations along with the corresponding un certainties. In addition, two different assumptions are examined with regards to the development of the capacity of the urban drainage system in response to urban development and climate change. In the ""stationary"" approach, the capacity resembles present-day design, while it is updated in the ""evolutionary"" approach to correspond to changes in imperviousness and precipitation intensities due to urban development and climate change respectively. For all four cities, we find an increase in flood exposure corresponding to an observed absolute growth in impervious surfaces of 7-12% during the past 30 years of urban development. Similarly, we find that climate change increases exposure to pluvial flooding under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The relative importance of urban development and climate change on flood exposure varies considerably between the cities. For Odense, the impact of urban development is comparable to that of climate change under an RCP 8.5 scenario (2081-2100), while for Vienna and Strasbourg it is comparable to the impacts of an RCP 4.5 scenario. For Nice, climate change dominates urban development as the primary driver of changes in exposure to flooding. The variation between geographical locations is caused by differences in soil infiltration properties, historical trends in urban development and the projected regional impacts of climate change on extreme precipitation. Developing the capacity of the urban drainage system in relation to urban development is found to be an effective adaptation measure as it fully compensates for the increase in runoff caused by additional sealed surfaces. On the other hand, updating the drainage system according to changes in precipitation intensities caused by climate change only marginally reduces flooding for the most extreme events.",,0,Odense; Vienna; Strasbourg; Nice,DNK; AUT; FRA; FRA,10.5194/hess-21-4131-2017,SRID=4326;POINT (10.38831 55.39594); SRID=4326;POINT (16.37208 48.20849); SRID=4326;POINT (7.74553 48.58392); SRID=4326;POINT (7.26608 43.70313),145931; 1691468; 274845; 338620,Comparison of the impacts of urban development and climate change on exposing European cities to pluvial flooding,2017
